God protect him!Glory be to Franz Joseph!Always procrastinating, always hesitating,- signing on the dot for country and God.- Be smooth! Be fake! Be sly!May I most humbly remind His Majestythat the carriage to Bad Ischl is waiting?But what shall I tellthe Russian ambassador?Others may quarrel.Austria, the fortunate, prefers to marry.August 1853. A rendezvous in Bad Ischl,far from Vienna, at the foot of the Alps.Ah, perché no?It's summer in Bad Ischl,the sky is high and blue.Hope beats in every heart.Sophie told her sister exactly what to do,but things went badly from the start.- What happened? You're late!- There was a thunderstorm!We need to rest.Out of the question!The meeting's scheduled for four o'clock.- What?- Helene looks terrible!Max sends his apologies.But look, we've brought Sisi with us.Your dress is most unflattering!Your hairstyle is grotesque!- I'll get changed!- Too late for that!No one makes an emperor wait!A perfect plan is fine in theorybut you never know how it will end.There's only one thing certain and that is:it won't work out the way it's planned.- Now, spit it out, Franz, tell uswhat you think of her. - Who?Why, your charming little cousin.She's like a tempting almond,so fresh, it's splitting.She makes him talk like a poet.Her eyes are soft and sweet and gentle.Her lips are red as strawberries.- And her hips are broad enough for babies!- Well?- At the ball tonight I'll dancewith no one else! - Yes?He likes her!Then, come on, invite her right now.Stand up! Walk up to her.Embrace her!Well?What? Her?A perfect plan is fine in theory,but you never know how it will end.There's only one thing certain and that is:it won't work out the way it's planned.I learned to be suave,look solemn and grave,I was so afraid.Three years of punitive instructionand tuition.In vain! All in vain!A perfect plan is fine in theory,but you never know how it will end.There's only one thing certain and that is:it won't work out the way it's planned.There's only one thing certain and that is:it won't work out the way it's planned.You must know one thing,what I have is not an easy life.Sometimes you'll find it hardto be an emperor's wife.What is important for othersdoesn't count for me.There'll be many changes.I'll hold on to you.Nothing's hard as long as you are near.Even in my hours of darknessI will have no fear.Every time I'm falling apart,I look up to you and take heart.I can't go wrong as long as you are here.Burdened by many dutieswe must fulfil our tasks.We'll make our dreams come true.Are we sad or happy?We're not allowed to ask.We'll get what we pursue!I'd like to be in your shoesjust for one day,to better understand the things you say.I give you this necklace to show youhow dear you are to me.How precious!I love you, I need you!The chain is heavy!Every time I'm falling apart,I look up to you and take heart.I can't go wrong as long as you are here.I love you.I need you.Never let me go!Vienna's Augustinian Church at 6.30pm.Rather strange to marry at this late hour.But in this case, on 24 April 1854,it's fitting.Very fitting, porca miseria!Our confidence is wearing thin,our certainties give way to doubt.The walls around us are closing inand we all know there's no way out.We're bored to death and loathe our lives,we're never ever satisfied.We're killing time by starting fights,we're short of love and full of pride.We're rude because we're too refined,been senile since our early youth.We're evil when we're nice and kindand lying when we talk of truth.'Cause nothing's ugly, nothing's fairand nothing's new beyond the dawn.We've heard it all and ceased to care,and miracles just make us yawn.For all the questions have been askedand all the curtains have been torn.We play the last act gaily masked,we've longed for death since we were born.We welcome you without restraint,we're almost honest when we cheer.Because we want to be entertained,we'd love to see you perish here.Elisabeth.Elisabeth.If this is your intention, answer “| do'!- I do!- I do!This marriage is your doing,my dear sister-in-law.- Are you happy now?- No.But my congratulations to you, sir,as the father of the bride.I don't want your congratulations.Love makes her dumb.It's not easy to give oneself to this man.Vienna is a trap. She must escapewhile she can.Love makes him blind,Franz is out of his mind.- I've warned him, now it's too late.- Why her of all people?It drives me wildto see this childfoiling the plans I have made.- This country brat lacks what's needed- The emperor lacks what's needed,- to be an emperor's wife.- what my Sisi needs.I look at them and tell myself:- he's no good for her.- she's no good for him.- Wasn't that a lovely wedding!- Rauscher's sermon went on and on!- How do you like our new empress?- She looks nice enough.New to court. Simple to mould.- For us she's easy prey.- Still a child!There have been bad omens:in the treasure chamberthe crown fell down this morning.She is naive!And when she got out of the carriageour young empress almost lost- her new tiara.- She's struggling.- It's like a fairy story,- Eyes red with tears, awkward and meek,- a child becomes an empress.- So charmingly helpless, like a sheep.- A rarity these days.- She's unimportant, a non-entity.She fits in well here.She doesn't fit in here.- She fits in well here.- She doesn't fit in here.The classical dilemma has just begun.You're torn between two lovers,who's the one?You have made your mind upbut you're still distressed,while I'm at your wedding as a guest.You turned your face awaybut it was just a game.You promised to be faithful and bear his name.Why did you invite me all the same?Leaning on his shoulderyou still smile at me,knowing very well what's meant to be.The final dance we're dancing on our own.The final dance is mine alone.This world is old and tired,the wine gets stale.The air grows close and stifling,the lights turn pale.Hidden eyes are watching everything we do.They anticipate our rendezvous.The final dance we're dancing on our own.The final dance is mine alone.So I wait in the darknessbut I'm not giving in.I may look like the loserbut I know I'll win.The final dance we're dancing on our own.The final danceis mine alone.- The final dance is mine alone.- Vienna's falling, doomsday's calling.- The final dance we're dancing on our own.- All the questions have been asked.- The final dance...- ...Is mine alone.- The final dance...- ...we're dancing......on our own.- Where is the empress?- She's still asleep, Your Highness!Then it's high time she woke up!What is it?You must get used to sleeping less.- Why?- From now on no more idleness!I was so tired.You must be up and dressed promptlyat five o'clock every morning.Franz Joseph told me I should take a rest,I feel weak and exhausted.Weak and exhausted? This must be a jest.- I know you didn't over-exert yourselflast night. - I don't believe it!- Neither do I.- He wouldn't tell you our bedroom secrets.My son tells me everything.- You're lying!- Why don't you ask him?- I will!- He came here with me.An empress shines resplendentin obedience, not in beauty,bears the dynasty descendants,does her duty!And now show me your teeth!- My teeth? - Yes, is that so hard?- Open your mouth wide!- They're yellow, just as I suspected.- Am I a horse?Lord no, but you're a role model.All you do is criticize,all that I want you deny me.I'll make an empress out of you,however you try to resist and defy me.I think you are just jealous of me.Jealous of you? That's ridiculous!I want...- First learn to be humble and sweet.- I'd like to... - No!Help me, Franz Joseph!Look how your mother torments me!An empress shines resplendentin obedience, not in beauty.She torments me, she locks me up. Help me!Don't leave me alone!Forget your pride. Stay by my side.For both of us it would be betterif you just do what my mother says.Be stern!Be bold!Be hard!So you've abandoned me.I will not be educated,obedient and well behaved.I will not be steadyand ready to be enslaved.I don't want to be your propertybecause I belong to me.When I walk the tightropedon't stop me, just let me try.I want to take chances,find out what it takes to fly.I don't care at all if you agree.I belong to me.If you try to mould me to fit in your play,you force me to leave you alone.If you try to hold me I'll just break awayto be what I am on my own.I'm freezing, I'm burning,you can't put me on the shelf.I'm growing, I'm learningto be even more myself.I know it's not easy to be freebut I belong to me.I just belong to me.I hate to be burdenedwith duties and ancient lies.Can't stand to be touchedby the gaze of a thousand eyes.I flee from the crowd in agony.I just belong to me.If you want to find me,don't hold me so tight,don't break me and don't take me on.If you want to bind me I'm ready to fight.I'll shake off my chains and be gone.I'm here when you need me,I live and I die with you.I'll share all your troubles,I'll laugh and I'll cry with you.You can blame me and bless mebut you cannot possess me,because I belong to me.Only to me!How beautiful the empress is.What is her position on Hungary?She loves whatever her mother-in-law hates.Then she'll back our fight for independence.She looks sad.Her children are ill.I hear little Sophie has a high fever.Worry makes her even more beautiful.No!You and I, we danced togetherjust like two birds of a feather.You need me.Yes, you need me.Isn't now the time to severall the chains and ties that bind you?Leave the one you're with forever.You'll drag him into the dark!The shades of night are growing.Your stars fade out and lose their glow.The shades of night are growing.This world is dying with you.You'd better let it go.The world is coming to an end, indubbiamente.At court, they haven't noticed yet.But in Vienna's coffee houses,everybody knows.- What's in the newspaper?- How is the bouillon?- Does anyone want to play cards?- God, I'm so bored.Our emperor is young and strong- but in politics he's going wrong.- Another brandy!The last Crimean Warbadly weakened us.And now Austria is politically isolated.France, England, Russia are allies.And now there is war with Piedmont.So what? We just sit around in cafes,yawning and waiting for the apocalypse.This time she's had a boy,let's shout “Hooray”.Once more they've taken the baby away.I hear she favours the Hungarians.A liberal mind! The radical kind!A very peculiar dame!So what? That's goodfor the apocalypse.When Rudolf was born,his mother had a terrible vision.She saw blood-red bannersand masses of people on the streets,who raised their fists against her.And there stood her own son on a barricade,the leader of the revolution!- How wonderfully eccentric!- How decadent!Austria needs a parliament.So what? We just sit around in cafes,yawning and waiting for the apocalypse.So what? We just sit around in cafes,yawning and waiting for the apocalypse.- Because we're bored and desolate.- Chuckle, chatter, grizzle, grumble...Because we don't care,because what's coming- and what's bound to happen will happen!- ...gobble, squabble, drinking coffee!Stop!Where are you going?Her Majesty desires me to fetchher son to walk with her.She says it's been three weekssince Rudolf came to talk with her.The crown prince stays here.These visits are not good for him.There's too much mollycoddlingand far too little discipline.To make him a real manI'll send him to Count Gondrecourtfor press-ups, cold showersand drilling in the art of war.But he's only a child!Even so.We can't let a prince run around wild.Those chosen by God to be kingmustn't show they're weak in anything.Why can't I go to see Mama?Because you can't.You'll be a soldier.A future emperor can't be a mummy's boy.Please!No!What the empress desires is irrelevantand you will continue to obeymy instructions.Elisabeth?I's me, my angel.Open up and let me in.I need your sweet love.My day's been awful, I need to unbend.French threats with no solution.Scandals that never seem to end.State bankruptcy, war and revolution.Restless academics, a new epidemic.Soothe me and relax me,shut out the evil that distracts meand while I'm sleeping hold me tightand help me make it through the night.Open up, give me your hand.Show me that you understand, Elisabeth.Don't come to me,go to your mother as always.You always did prefer her.- My angel... What have I done wrong?- Forget it!You allow Rudolf to be tortured.Rudolf? Tortured?I found out that your motherhanded him over to a cruel torturer.He's being trained like me to be emperor.He's still too soft.You'll both destroy him!But I won't sit and watch any longer.It's her or me!I have drafted a formal ultimatum.If you don't want to lose me,comply with it.I demand total control over the educationof my children.And from now on, I myself will decidewhat I do or do not do.Read it and make a decision:your mother or me.And now leave me alone.Elisabeth, don't despair.Come to me and find your peace.I will console you.Flee and I'll release you,give up the fight and I will ease you.Just leave this nightmare and be freeto find the real reality.Elisabeth!I love you!No! I'm scared of dying,I'm still too young to give up trying.I've overcome my apathy.I'll use my beauty to break free.Go! I don't want you,I don't need you. Go!When do we get milk?Why must we always wait?No delivery today!Cheated again, our cans empty again,and we've been standing hereall night in vain.Constantly swindled, our hope has dwindled,who is the person to blame?They guzzle, laughing, while we are starvingand hardly get a crumb.- Shame!- Do you know who takes the milk away?- Well, who?- They confiscate the milk for her each day!- Who for? - Why, for your empress,because she needs it for...- What for? - Her bath.- What? - Yes!- What a vile disgrace!- Yes, a disgrace!I never thought she'd be so mean.You never thought she'd be so mean!Children dying becausewe can't get any milkand she bathes in it.Chase the depravers, oust the enslavers,- leeches that suck our blood.- Stamp them into the mud!Throw out the dastards,drive out those bastards,stamp them into the mud!- Enough!- Do you want to know the empress's cares?- Well, what? - She looks in her combto count the torn-out hairs.- How come?- She weeps in sorrow in mourning for...- For what? - Her hair!- What? - Yes!Time for us to fight!Teach them a lesson!- Fight for your dignity!- No more degradation!Bread for the poor!We must unite!- War on the palaces!- Power to the people!Comrades, be prepared and spread the word,the hour of truth is near.At last our day is here!The empress is in her bath.If you approach her, hold your breath,and gently, to avoid her wrath,pour hot milk bit by bit into the tub.- Now, are her towels properly fluffed?- Every thread!- Has the shampoo been mixed and stirred?- As you said:a glass of brandy then the eggs,three for every glass.She insists on it!The imperial resplendence needsan empress who's a beautybecause to represent transcendenceis her duty.What, the emperor? That's odd.He's never come at this hour before.Where is the empress”?- She hasn't finished her toilet yet,Your Majesty. - I have to talk to her!I just came to tell youthat I will meet your demands.I will not compel you,you may take the child in hand.I'll change everything you want me tobut please don't say we're through.As of now you will educate Rudolfand decide what happens here.Whatever the world wants me to do,my heart belongs to you.I hide what I feel and I sham.Emotions don't guide me as long as I rule.But then if you avoid meI just can't stay cool.For you I'll betray what I am.I will be on your sideif you are on my side too.Just leave me my freedom,that's all I ask of you.I don't want to be your property.Because I belong to me.- Perhaps you can win me,- The blossoms of today- but only if I go free.- tomorrow scatter far and wide.- If you want to start over,- Nothing's here to stay,- you must take the real me.- time is on my side.There's nothing you owe me,just let me go free!- I belong to me!- You belong to me.Elisabeth!Belong only to me!Roll up, roll up,ladies and gentlemen!Inside the cathedral on this remarkable day,8 June 1867,the Emperor of Austria andthe preternaturally beautiful Elisabethare being crowned King and Queen of Hungary,and you have a once-in-a-lifetime chanceto purchase a valuable souvenirto take home.Everything's very cheap. So please, step up!How would you like this card?It shows our lovely empresswith Rudolf on her knee.And this one is real art:the whole imperial familyaround the Christmas tree.Then, painted on this glass,the loving couple on their wedding day.And on this demitassethe beautiful Elisabethkneeling down to pray.Take a pretty souvenir home,I've got the cheapest and the best.Quite delightful, most insightful,with the imperial crest.Kitsch!Kitsch!Kitsch!Do I see the hypocrites frown,pretending they care about truth?The truth is very cheapbut no one wants to buy it,it's depressingly uncouth.A century has passedand still Elisabeth has sex appeal.But who she really wasno book, no movie and no showcan possibly reveal.They envied and despised her,threw gold at her and smut,worshipped and idolized herand now she's nothing but...Kitsch!Kitsch!Kitsch!The real truth is: sweet Sisi was a toughand selfish woman who struggled to be free.Almost everything she did was doneonly to make clearthat she was stronger than Sophie.She fought to get her sonbut later when he needed hershe was never around.While living off the monarchyshe put her trust in Switzerlandand a numbered account.If this should make you moody,there is no need to flap,for bleakness just like beauty boilsdown to coloured crap.Kitsch!Kitsch!Kitsch!Kitsch!- What a triumph!- My triumph!- What a feast!- My feast!I've shown my enemies defiance.This is how you change the worldthe way I want,a pretty cool alliance.- It wasn't for the world.- Not for the world.- Just for me.- For me.Now I have found my self-reliance.They never did a thing but sneer,but now they know you're one to fearand you have won.They thought that they could pull my strings,tie me down to earth and clip my wings.But I'm no little dancing puppet now!When I choose to dance,then I will dance to my own tune.I alone will pay the piper.I alone decide with whom.When I choose to dance,then I will dancethat dance in my own special way,high on the cliff edgeor reflected in your eyes.Midnight seagull, fly!I fly alone!I am here to offer you protection.I don't need your protection nownor anyone's.I don't want your affection.- Freedom only comes from me.- Just from me.- Just for me.- For me.You can't deny our close connection.We both must go our separate ways.I want no more to do with you.Leave me alone!You know you fell in love with mebecause only I can set you free.And no one understands you except me.When I choose to dance,then I will dance to my own tune.I alone will pay the piper.I alone decide with whom.When I choose to dance,then I will dancethat dance in my own special way,high on the cliff edgeor reflected in your eyes.I'm strong enough alone.Not strong enough to face the worldwithout me on your own.- I don't need you.- Wrong, you will need me.- I won't heed you.- Wrong, you will heed me.- I'm starting to love life!- Soon you will learn to hate it!When I choose to dance,then I will dance to my own tune.I alone will pay the piper.I alone decide with whom.When I choose to dancethen I will dance to my own tune.High on the cliff edgeor reflected in your eyes.When I choose to danceand with whom I choose to danceI will decide alone.Mama? Mama?Mama, where are you?Why don't you hear me?Where have you gone? Mama, I miss you.They all sayI mustn't disturb you.Why can't I be with you?Mama, my room is terribly gloomy.I'm scared to death,why don't you come to me?No one's here to stroke my hairwhen I cry.Why do you leave me all alone?Don't cry for her, she's outward bound!Who are you?I am your friend.If you need help I'll be around.Stay with me!I'll stay at hand!If I try hard I can be a hero.Yesterday I killed a cat for fun.I can be brave, I won't let a tear show,but sometimes I would rather be weak.Oh Mama, I always want to be with youbut you've gone away and I'm left behind.And when you're here you stay on your own.Why do you leave me alone?Your Majesty! It's a great honour!I wish to see the patients now.Let go of her!I want to talk to her.- Bow down, get on your knees!- Such cheek!That's not the empress!I am Elisabeth!I wish I could be you for real,in a straitjacketeveryone can see.They only cease to choke your soulwhen they've fettered your body.I've struggled so hardto assert my own rights.Now, what am I left with?Nought, nil, nothing.For the only solution would be madnessand the only escape would be to leap.The deepest abyss calls me.I long to drown in the darkness,why do I shy away from the plunge?Were I not condemned by fateto be Elisabeth,I'd like to be Titania.Then I would smile when people sayshe is insane.I'm right on the brinkand I tremble with fearbecause when I look down, I see nothing.I'm groping my way, I shiver and sway.I'm horrified becausedown there's just nothing.Only madness might give me freedom.But of madness I'm too afraid.So I act like I'm strong and try to pretendthat I live a lifethat's filled with meaning,as if nought, nil, nothing, is enough.Otherwise she's well, she helpsFranz Joseph rule the land.He dares not make a movewithout her at his back.Archduchess Sophie fearsa swift defeat at Sisi's handand goes on the offensive for a last attack.I'm outraged!We must contend or see the monarchy end!Franz Joseph ignores my advice.Elisabeth throws the dice.The question is: we or she?This state of affairs frightens me.It's got to be changed, yes, and soon.The emperor dances to her tune.- I have to say, I find her attractive.- You do?Well, as a man...She really is beautiful.Other women are beautiful too.- Oh yes, I see.- Is this a plan?An idea?You've got to fight fire with fire!To fight a witch......you need a bitch.Someone whose wiles will enslave him.The emperor must burn,a little lust might save him.It would serve our turnif someone else should turn his head.An intimate night with some sweet bellecould break the spell.I'll undertake to supply himwith a mademoiselle.But discreetly, Grünne.From a moral point of view,I strongly object to this suggestion.However, from a political standpoint,I'd say the idea is excellent.Put on a bright face,this is the right place!Lay down your money, call for your honey,sip your champagne and relax.Madame Wolf knows wellhow to ring your bell.Luscious bodies, tempting eyes...Always ready with a sweet surprise.Some fear that this locationmay hurt their reputation,a trusted servant will come by instead.Carrying out his duties,he checks on all the beautiesto find the right one for his master's bed.- This one's been sent by a real high-up.- This servant deserves to be admired.He chooses with an expert's eye.Her cheeks burn with a feverish glow.The reason why he does not know.Put on a bright face, this is the right place,we'll get your woes off your backs.Lay down your money, call for your honey,sip your champagne and relax.Madame Wolf knows wellhow to ring your bell.Luscious bodies, tempting eyes...But be ready for a sweet surprise!Your Majesty!What's the matter?I found her lying there unconsciousunder the rings.She must have been taken dizzy.No wonder when she refuses to eat.Leave us alone!Your pulse...I'm much better.Your temperature's quite high.I'm fine!Your lips are dry.If I'm not mistaken,and I'd much prefer to be,this is a certain notorious malady.An infection, Your Majesty.Not life-threatening,but unpleasant.What they call the French pox.That's outrageous! How dare you suggest it.What you are saying is utter madness!Impossible? Why? An emperor, face fit,is only a man.- He would never be unfaithful!- Almost never.My God, if you're right then my husbandhas dragged me through the mud and mire!- I fear it is so.- I swear I will never forgive him,I'll leave him forever!Or better yet I'll kill myself!Do it, Elisabeth! I'm waiting for you.You?Now this could be your final chance,it's time to take a stand. Flee with me!Come, dance with me the final dance,don't miss it, take my hand.No, I will not!My husband's done me a favour.Because when his moral standards sinkmy freedom starts to soar.Now I have every right to leaveand leave the life I loathe behind me.He did wrong so I do rightto break the chains that bind me.Go!Mother, this is quite enough,I've had it up to here.Do you feel no sense of shameat how you interfere?- Don't use that tone with me! - How my wifeconducts herself is none of your affair.- Ridiculous!- Stop your bloody interfering!Interfering?You have no inkling what's at stake!This is the point of make or break.She's stirring Hungary up again.Years of work, down the drain,she's impossible!Is it true?- It's true, I'll foil all her plans.- And mine.- And wrest the empire from her hands.- No, from mine.Your wife despises you, you churl.Since I've met other girlsI love her even more.An empress shines resplendent...You torment us, you interfere!...bears the dynasty descendants,does her duty.But never will I think less of her!Think less of her?My God!Is that what you think this is about?This time I won't take your advice.My marriage is too high a price.I'll stand by her whatever you may do!Is that my reward, you ungrateful son?I gave you an empire,that gift was hard-won.To be steely and strong wasn't easy to do.I made myself learn it,strength and steel, for you.The emperor must rule with an iron hand.When weakness destroys you,then you'll understand,understand me.Hiking with the empressis a real marathon.We yearn for a little breather,she wants to walk right on.First we climb the mountains,then we rush to the sea.She runs ahead with giant stride,we follow breathlessly.Our feet are sore and tired,we pray for our relief.When we're hiking with the empress,eight hours is not brief.Mirror, mirror, tell the truth,I don't intend to be uncouth,but after ten years one may wonderwhat's become of her youth. Tell us!Cosa stai combinando?A grey hair.Che scocciatura!- Since Mother's death, my angel,- She buys horses.- I miss you even more.- She learns Greek,- Rudolf will be twenty-eight soon,- writes poetry,- he does what I abhor.- exercises, starves herself.Hiking with the empressis a real marathon.We yearn for a little breather,she wants to walk right on.She runs ahead with giant stride,we follow breathlessly.For eighteen years she's been on the runavoiding almost everyone.So mirror, mirror, one does wonder,is her beauty still there?

Blood! Glory! Unity! Purity! Might!Sieg Heil!How often |I've waitedfor you to speak.How I hopedyou would finally break the silence.Perhaps you're afraidbecause I am so much like you.So insulated, so bored and jadedand always trying to flee.Sometimes I'd rather bethe mirror you are turning to.You'd see yourself in meand feel what I am going through.Until you shiveredbecause you recognized me in you.Whenever we meetI'm either too late or too early.When I entreat,you're distant and cold like the moon.I'm drawn to you, there's no oneI ever loved more.But I can't remake me,I know you'll forsake meand push me away like before.Sometimes I'd rather bethe mirror you are turning to.You'd see yourself in meand feel what I'm going through.Why this intrusion?I hate to be disturbed.Mother...I need you.I'm in the deepest trouble. Their spiesdiscovered me and now the hunt is on.I'm standing on the brink of dish on ourand disgrace.You're the only one I can trust.I am trapped, there's no escape.I find the court a torment.I don't want to know.But this shameful scandal's the last straw.You're my one last chanceto reach the emperor.Please!

I don't want you!Not like this! I don't need you!Go!My new assortment includes this beautifulcollection which will appeal to everyone.An impressive collection!Our poor, unhappy empress shownas a mourning motherat the coffin of her son.It would melt a heart of stoneand might even make you contemplatehow lucky you are to be humble,for the mighty, rich and famousface a far worse fate.The bigger they come, the harder they fall.So my story offers moral consolationafter all.Kitsch!Kitsch!The empress, by the way,still travels here and there,to hike and fast and mourn.And every now and thenthe emperor follows her,stubborn in spite of her scorn.And if he ever arrives before she leaves,they may meet some day.Let's picture this romancedeep in the night above some moonlit bay.Come back, Sisi.We belong together.My faith in us was always strong.I love you.And love, they say,can heal all wounds.Love can do much but sometimesit doesn't bring relief.Faith can be strong but sometimesit's only make-believe.We asked for miraclesbut they never came true.There was never any chance,what could we do?We are just like two boats in the night.We must sail to different shoresbefore we see the light.Every time we meet out at seawe pass by as close as can be.We never touch, we drift away from sight.Why all or nothing?A little can sometimes be a lot.Your dream's too small for me.Why can't you stay beside me?You're everything I've got.In your shadow I'm not free.If you could be in my shoesjust for one day,maybe you'd understand what I can't say.We are just like two boats in the night.We must sail to different shoresbefore we see the light.Every time we meet out at seawe dream dreams and know it can't be.The happiness we sought vanished from sight.Don't leave me! I need you!I love you! Don't let it all be gone!- We must sail to different shores- Don't leave me! I need you!- Before we see the light.- I love you! Don't let it all be gone!Every time we meet out at seawe dream dreams and know it can't be.The happiness we soughtvanished out of sight.I love you!Accept it. It was never meant to be.All the questions have been askedand all the curtains have been torn.We play the last act gaily masked,we've longed for death since we were born.Our confidence is wearing thin,our certainties give way to doubt.The walls around are closing inand we all know there's no way out.Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria!Well, what is this? A madhouse?- Your sinking ship, Your Majesty.- Why am I here?You tell me. This is your nightmare!All a nightmare!Where is Elisabeth?Elisabeth? My Elisabeth?- My Elisabeth!- She belongs to me!- What impertinence!- She loves me.- Enough of this nonsense!- Well, this is your nightmare.- I gave her my whole life.- A pathetic gift!I gave her security and fame.I can give her freedom!All a nightmare!- The long-awaited hour of truth is near.- Are you taking her from me?- I'm saving her.- You?
