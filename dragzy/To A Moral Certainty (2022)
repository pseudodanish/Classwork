and deliberations that youwill enter into shortlyand the decisions that youwill come to as a groupwill end up being themost important decisionof your lifetime.I appreciate that you havelistened to the argumentswhich have been made by mybrother and sister in the lawin terms of the other twopositions that have been presentedthat are held by membersof the faith of Judaism,the faith of Islam,those who are agnostic,those who are atheist...and I now ask you to listento my closing argument,as I present to you, ourview of what we believethe evidence has shown.This case starts in Bethlehem,where this man Jesus was born.His life here on earthends at Golgotha,the place of the cross.But the question mark thatyou will have to decideis what happened in that tomband how that bodygot out of that tomb.Let me start byexplaining what the threeof us all agree on.First of all,there's no questionabout whether Jesus wasan historical figure.There are manysecular historianswho have spent their livesresearching the time periodof Jesus of Nazareth.Also, there's no questionthat Jesus was crucified.There were many, manywitnesses to the crucifixionincluding not the leastof which, a Roman Centurionand a Roman guard.And third... that from thetime that he left the cross,and was put into the tomb,that just two days after heleft the cross, was empty.The body was not there.How did that happen?Well, you have heardthe three options.Option number one isthat Jesus got outof that tomb on his own,which would mean hedidn't die on the cross.He may have been suffering,but he somehow recoveredinside the tomb andsomehow got out on his own.Second, is that somebody,friend or foe stole the body,dead or alive.And option number three,is that as Jesus predictedhe was resurrected from death.From that witness stand,you have heard historicalexperts who are secularwho simply toldyou about the time.We've heard frommedical experts.We've heard from eye witnesses,to the passion and thecrucifixion that occurred.And we have heard fromthe written testimonyfrom back at that time. FromMatthew, Mark, Luke and John,what are commonly referredto as the Four Gospels;who wrote both whatthey saw as wellas what they collected interms of testimony from others.But in this courtroom, youare to take that testimonyfrom that stand thatwas given to youfrom those Four Gospelsas sworn depositionsof those individuals, becauseindeed it is testimonythat those four men protectedand shared with the world.Now let's talk aboutthe historical evidence.Matthew testifiedabout the tomb.He explained, first of allthat there was arock that was placedin front of theentrance to the tomb.Second, he explainedthat the tomb was sealed,and third, Matthew explainedthat a guard was setin front of the tomb.Now, why would theRomans go to such troublein guarding a dead body?Well, first it was a precautionagainst the very thingthat the Jewish authoritieswere concerned about,and that is that body beingstolen, because they wantedto protect against anytalk of a resurrection.You can go to Israel today andsee tombs just like the onethat Jesus was put in.You've essentially gota cave that is dug outand then there'll be an opening.And then there'sgoing to be a closureof the opening by a stone.What we know about Jesus'tomb is this... Mark wroteas you heard fromthe witness standin a fourth century manuscriptthat the stone that wasplaced in front of Jesus' tombwas so large that even20 men could not move itonce it was set in place.Is it possible?Like my opponents say thatin the middle of the night,the followers of Jesus camemaybe with some special toolsor something likethat and were ableto get that big stone moved.Yeah, that's possible.Is it likely?No.If you remember A.T Robinson,the New Testament scholar,explained that the sealing ofthe tomb was done by a cordthat would be stretchedacross the tomband then both ends of the cordwould be stamped withthe Imperial Seal.Why do that?What's that all about?Well, that sealwas of the Romans,the people who occupiedIsrael at that time.You break that cord,you break that sealand the full power ofRoman law and authoritycomes down on you.(dramatic music)Let's also rememberthis, Jesus at that timewas the most notoriouscriminal in all of Jerusalem.The Romans andthe Jewish leadersdidn't wanna take anychances, the Roman guardwas at the tomb aroundthe clock at all hours.And remember the testimonyof professor Daniel Whedon,who's a Professorof Ancient Languagesat Wesleyan University,who explainedthat a guard is not one person,but instead 16 soldiers.We know that Roman guardstook their jobs seriously.And why is that?Because of the punishmentthat was inflicted on youin the event thatyou did not do so.If you abdicated your duties,if you fell asleep on thejob, if you walked awayfrom being on watch, yourpunishment was death.They literally threwyou off a cliff.And all the guards knew that.So you can rest assured thatthat guard stayed vigilantthroughout the timethat they were there.And remember somethingabout this guard.On the very day theytook their post,members of that same groupof soldiers flogged Jesuswithin an inch of his life.And what does that mean?It means taking the leatherstraps that are loaded downwith rocks and have glass putin them and sharpened bonesand taking them to theman's front and his back,and whipping him 39 times tearingthe flesh off of his body.And then they took that manand they had himcarry his own crossand they nailed him withrailroad spikes to a cross.And then they sat thereand with their Centurionwho was in charge, theywatched for six hourswhile the man died,while he slowly suffocatedfrom his own body weight.No, the positionof the Roman guardsand their feelings about Jesusof Nazareth is crystal clear.Their allegiance was to Rome.And that's where it stayed.Well, think aboutthis hypothetical.Let's take what we saidbefore and just add to it,which is, maybe in themiddle of the nightyou got the 11 apostlesor however manyfollowers were needed.And they come in with specializedtools and they come inwith a counterfeit stampand they pry the thing open,get Jesus' body out, putthe cord back over itand use the counterfeitstamp and seal it up again.And everything's good.Is that possible?Yeah, it's possible.But in your life experienceand common sense,does that make anysense to you whatsoever?No. It's doubtful.Now opposing counselwould have you believethat Jesus was justan historical figure,barely charismatic,because he had a followingby just some guy from the sticksand that this whole thingabout the resurrection,is a hoax, clever, makebelieve a performance.And they would have youlook at Jesus as beinga well-spoken controversial,radical troublemaker. Butlet's remember the teachingof Occam's razor, whichis the theory thatoftentimes the simplestexplanation is the correct one.Well, you know, there aresome people who believethat Jesus did notdie on the cross,that he was merelytortured, fell unconscious,body put into the tomb,gets out of tomb on its ownbut it comes back to,did he die on the cross?What do we know?There were two thingsthat are important to knowother than that Romansknow how to kill.And that is at theend of the six hours,as was explainedfrom the gospel,a Roman guard took a spearand thrust it into the sideof Jesus and both blood and aclear fluid, water, came out.Well, we know frommedical science todaythat from the bloodloss that Jesus had,that he would havedeveloped probably eitheror both pleural effusionwhich is water on the lungsor pericardial effusionwhich is watersurrounding the heart.And if there was enoughwater in Jesus' chestso that when he was piercedwith a spear into the heartor into the lung, sothat water came outso that the Romans can see it,you know one thing. You knowthat that man is in a stateof hypovolemic shock. Andmost of us in this courtroomwould have a difficulttime survivingunder those circumstances,even with today'smodern medicine.We also know that there'sanother test here.Its because it was Passover,you couldn't continuewith a crucifixiononce it became dark.Because it wouldviolate Jewish lawand this was the Passover.So these people had to be dead.So they broke the legs.The Roman guards broke thelegs of the other two menwho were on either side ofJesus, who were being crucified.Now why do that?Well, it means youcan't push up anymore.So you're like thisand you suffocatefrom your own body weight,but they didn't dothat with Jesus.They didn't break his legs.Why is that?They certainly didn't haveany problem torturing him.It's not like theyfelt for the guy.Its because they knewhe was already dead.Again, John, the eyewitnessknew he was dead.Ladies and gentlemen,Jesus died on that cross.The idea that hedidn't is foolishness.Now you mightwonder how the ideaof Occam's razor explainswhat is truly a miracle?I mean, a resurrectionis a miracle.In this instance,there was no questionthat Jesus had alreadyperformed miracles.He turned the water into wineat the wedding in Canaanwas his first miracle.He went throughsystematically healing peoplewho were eitherblind or had leprosyor had other diseasesor problems since birth.He had fed 5,000 people witha few loaves and a few fish.And that was reported by everyone of the gospel writers,Matthew, Mark, Luke, andJohn, all four of them.Christ himself had even raisedother people from the dead.The testimony was that he haddone so on three occasions,one of them beingLazarus, his friendwho had been in thetomb for four days,but you know even theJewish leaders at the timethey didn't challenge whetherthe miracles occurred.They couldn't, there weretoo many witnesses to them.No, instead theychallenged him to his face,on more than oneoccasion asking,"By whose authority are youperforming these miracles?"That's what they wanted to know.So the idea of therebeing a miraclethat's not really in dispute.These were not shows.Now there aredifferences in testimony.A lot of people point that out.They say that well, youknow, when we listenedto these guys, explainwhat happened at the tomb.All their stories area little bit different,that ladies and gentlemenis common in trials.You can have one of themost straightforward cases,a bank robbery, okay?And you're gonna haveseveral witnesses, tellers,and customers, and whoeverelse is in the bank.And there's gonna bedifferences in their testimonyabout what the robber lookedlike, how tall the robber was,what the chronologyof events were,what the gun looked like,what the robber said.In fact, what you findis that if everybody saysthe exact same thing, thattestimony is not credible,because that just tells youthat everybody hasgotten together.It's the most normalthing for people to do.And quote, unquote, gottentheir stories straight.They're singingthe company song.That is not credible testimony.So how do you figureout what to dowhen you've got circumstanceswhere you've got differencesin the testimony?Is you look to see what isimportant about what occurred?Let's look to see whathappened in this case.All four of the gospel writerssay that Mary from Magdalaknown as Mary Magdalenewent to the tomb,all of the writers, explainthat that tomb was openand that it was empty.There are manyother similaritiesthat you heard thetestimony about,but three of the gospels told usthat there was a man onthe inside wearing white,possibly an angel who saidthat, "Jesus is not here.He is risen."You have a lot of othersimilarities in the testimony.But the most important isthat after that tomb is empty,Jesus himself appearedto dozens of people,including all 11 ofthe remaining apostles.And that he picked up tosome extent where he left offthat is he went up to Galileewhere he picked his apostlesfrom and he ate with them.And he walked with them.Unafraid, out in the open,even offered his woundsof his hands and hisside for others to seeincluding most notably,the apostle whom Ishare a first name withthat being Thomas.You know him probablyas the doubting Thomas,who did not believethat Jesus had arisen, eventhough his other apostles saidthat he had, thathe would not believeuntil he put his handsinto Jesus' wounds.So what did Jesus do?He appeared toThomas and he said,"Go ahead, put yourhands into my wounds."And Thomas on seeing this, hesees this man he's traveledwith for three years who nowis alive and in front of him.And he recognizes what happens.And he drops to his kneesand he looks right upin the face of the man.He knows his friend to be Jesus.And he says, "My Lord, my God."Why?Because he knew right then andthere that Jesus was Christ,he was the Messiah, he wasthe son of the living God.Well, the feat of whathappened was so staggering,was so convincing,was so important.These men left everythingthey had and their homesand went to all fourcorners of the known world,and went ahead and preachedthe gospel of Jesus Christand think of what kindof men these were.These weren't some kind of nuts.They were fishermenfor the most part.Working class, theylived comfortably enough.They were relatively safe.They were up in Galilee.They went down in Jerusalemwhere all the Romans were.They left the safety of theirhomes and their occupations.And these guys traveledthrough the wilderness,the completely unknown partsof the world preachingthe gospel of Jesus Christthat he was the Son of God,preaching the resurrection,preaching eternal life.And where did they go?Think about it, NorthAfrica, Greece, India,modern day Russia, allto preach the gospel.Now they committed the restof their lives to this.And they ended up giving therest of their lives to this.These men who preached aboutJesus did so at a cost.And they knew what the cost was.Very first one whodied was Stephen.He was stoned to death.Thomas was killed with a spear.Bartholomew was flayedalive with a knifeand then was crucified.And this happened to one,after another, after anotherafter another.And these reports of thedeath of the apostles,they don't come fromthe New Testament.They come fromsecular historians.You can believe it.You don't have to believein the New Testamentto believe the waythat these men died.I'll tell you one thing,is that those guys werenot about to do thatif they thought that Jesushad pulled a fast one on them,no, they believed in a simpletruth that the resurrectionhad occurred just asJesus said, it would,the apostles understood theresurrection to be a simple factand a true miracle.And I think you maybelieve that as well.Now, the judge isgoing to instruct youon how to consider the evidence.You have two kinds of evidence.You have direct evidence, okay?Where someone sees,hears, smells,whatever through their senses,their personalwitnesses to something.And eye witness beingthe easiest example.There's also circumstantialevidence but what's that?Well say that, it's the eveningit's winter timeand you go to sleepand there's nosnow on the ground.Next morning, you wake upand there's an inchof snow on the ground.You conclude based upon that,based on your deduction that,well it must havesnowed last night.That's circumstantial evidence.Now, the judge isgoing to explain to youthat the law makesno distinctionbetween direct evidence andcircumstantial evidence.You're going to be instructedthat you are to make deductionsand reach conclusionswhich reason and commonsense would lead you to makeand that you should not beconcerned, whether that's basedon the evidence beingdirect or circumstantial.Is it realistic that Jesusdid not die on that crossand recovered in the tomband walked out on his own?Is it realistic that hisfollowers got through the guardand the cord that sealed itand the stone in orderto steal his body?Or is it realistic thatJesus did for himselfwhat he had done for others,and that is, the resurrection.And that's how the bodygot out of that tomb.In some instances, people usean erroneous standard to tryand judge these kinds of things.They say, well, you know,I'm not 100% convinced.Well, in the law,in this courtroom,there is no such standard, causein matters of human affairsthere's rarely asituation where any of uswould be 100% convinced.What we use in courts of lawlike this is the standardof reasonable doubt and beliefbeyond a reasonable doubt.Now, what is a reasonable doubt?It's that level of doubt thatwould cause you to hesitatein the most importantof your affairs.Our entire United States justicesystem on the criminal sideis based upon thatconcept of proofbeyond a reasonable doubt,but not based upon a 100%,'cause there's always somelevel of doubt in anything.I would submit to youthat is the standardthat you should use.And it's a high standard, thatyou look at the three optionsthe only possible three optionsand decide which onemeets that standard.Because if theresurrection occurred,it means that Jesusindeed was the Son of Godand that he defeated death.And that what John saidwas true, which is that,"God so loved the worldthat he gave to us his son,his only son, so that allwho would believe in himwould not perish, but wouldhave everlasting life."Which means if you believethat the resurrection occurredthat you will haveeverlasting life.So when you're deliberatingand when you're thinkingabout the evidence in this caseand the importance of thisdecision, it's not just this casethat you're deciding,no ladies and gentlemenit is your own lifethat you are deciding.It is your future,that you are deciding;both your life hereand your life eternal.The judge is goingto explain to youthat when you gointo that jury roomthere will be a verdictform for you to fill outat the end of yourdeliberations.And I'm going to read it to youexactly what that form says.You are going toselect one choice.It says as follows quote, "Ibelieve that to get Jesus' bodyout of the tomb, one,his body was stolen,or two, he did notdie on the cross,but instead he passedout and fell unconscious.And while in the tomb, herevived and got out on his own,or three, Jesuswas resurrected."There's the onlythree possibilities.You are to signyour name and date,the date of your verdict.And as you deliberate,the question that you reallyhave to ask yourself is this,who moved that stone?Ladies and gentlemen thankyou for your attentionduring my closing argument,and my explanationof what we, the ChristianChurch, believe occurredin that tomb.I ask you as you gofor your deliberationsthat you will listento one another.Use your mind, use your heart,use your soul, useyour conscience,and you consider everythingthat you've heardduring this past week.And you render a verdict whichis fair and speaks the truth.Thank you for your attention.(upbeat soft music)Judge: Thank you counselor.Jury, you have nowheard the full argumentsfrom members of eachfaith presented here.After I dismiss you,please go directlyto the deliberation roomand elect a foreperson.All the evidence will bewith you in the jury room,you may ask any questionor review any evidence necessarybut you must reach a verdict.You are now releasedto begin deliberation.(upbeat music)I understand you'vereached a conclusion.Foreperson, whatis your verdict?Foreperson: Your honor,we, the jury believe...
