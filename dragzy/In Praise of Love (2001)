We have a project.lt relates something of the storyof three couples:young, adult,and old.And this somethingis one of the four moments of love.The meeting,the physical passion,the separation...then the reconciliation.So what will you play?l think l'll play the young girl.l'm thinking of something.His name is Perceval.And her name will be Eglantine.l'm Eglantine.Do you understand it's notEglantine's story,but a moment in history...History moving through Eglantine?The moment of youth.Let's call it a sociological study.For example,when the old man and woman meet,it'll be in a soup kitchen.ln this project, in fact,we can't help but depict...depict the down-and-out.They're everywhere nowadays.The ones Victor Hugo...You know Victor Hugo?Take a seat.You can smoke if you want.What are you thinking about?l was wondering if my cigarettewould hold out till tonight.And if my laces would hold outtill tomorrow.And if my breathwould hold out till next week.Do you work?Yes, a lot.At night, too?Especially at night.And in the night of day.Do you ever cry?At first glance, you can seewhy children cry.While people are walking by.That's how Albertand Albertine loved each other.l don't know.lt all dependson how l still see myself.Someone who plansto keep moving aheadimplies that his previous selfis a self that no longer exists,and he loses interest in it.On the other hand,the plans of othersreject time...and thereby create a strong bondwith the past.lt's true of almost all old people.They can't abide timefor fear of wasting away.Everyone,in his heart of hearts...There are the poor.l don't know how memorycan help usreclaim our lives.lt's not whether man will endure,but whether he has the right to.Here comes the little fellow.ln ancient timesthey emphasized relationships.That's the fundamental question.Who's this one by?When will we have an answer?We still need a green lightfrom the national bank.You seem very fondof that young man.Too fond, in my opinion.That's your opinion, dear fellow.A thief is a thief, museum or not.They apologized.- Then neither did l.- You're different.What if they only returnthe Braque and Vlamincks.We know how they are.The Louvre curator wantsto protect the Winged Victory,but as author of this protectionon equal terms with Phidias.Times have changed.There's a feeling of yesteryear.lt's discouraging.Too many changes are in the airthat still lack a means of expression.We make fun of 1900 but our agewill probably seem just as ridiculous.And maybe just as charming.l don't know.Memory is a complex thing.When they were arrestedin the '42 roundup,Edgar's grandfather wasthe same age as Dad.They were partners in the gallery.l was 10. l'd play in the parkwith his daughter.l was madly in love.She preferred someone else.So l said to her,quoting Jouvet:''Happy with that hapless man?''What became of him?With her 50%,H?l?ne bought hima Gordini, then a Talbot.He killed himself at lndianapolis.The same year as Ascari.Then your debt is paid.But there's still memory.Yes, the obligations of memory.No, the right.Memory has no obligations.Read Bergson.Or else l muststill be in love.She looked like that girlin the Boubat photo,staring into the distance,wearing a black braunder her white blouse.- You've kept in touch with her?- No, she committed suicide.Luckily she had no signature power.l found 2 Corots at Vollard's,a Lichtenstein at Castelli's in NY,but too late.l managed to buy backthe little Breughel,but l think it's a copy.All that remains of this businessis that the boy make somethingmore than money.l got to know himby chance at the Soulages' home.Antoinette Sach's daughterintroduced us.l think she's Edgar's godmother.Maybe he's aware of the situation,but he said nothing.lt's still a lot.Even if it's a fine project.l have no idea what it's about.An opera, maybe. A film.A film in the documentary tradition.But l don't understand the term.And what's it called?Something ''to Love.''''Ode,'' l think.lsn't it strangehow works of art demand titles,- like in the days of nobility.- And Wall St.Speaking of films,did you know Henri Langlois?Not really.Meerson's wife, yes.But not him. Maybe once,at a lunch at the Raphael,in '58 or '59.lt seems he foundedthe Archive Federation herewith a German and a New Yorker.l forgot her name.ln 1938. lris Barry.See Counselor Forlani out.The Americans are everywhere,aren't they, sir?Who remembersVietnam's resistance?Explain it better.lt's like this...With young people it's obvious.You pass them in the streetand the first thing you say is:they're youngsters.With old people,same thing.Before anything else,you think:that's an old man.But with adults,it's anything but obvious.They're never entirely naked,so to speak.They have to have a story,even in porno movies.l understand.We have to examine this businessmore closely,but l see the point you're making.We need the three ages, you see.Or else the project's dead.lt becomes a story with Julia Roberts...Hollywood.Not History.Yes, l understand. lt's hard.But you'll find something.And that young ladyPhilippe told me about.Still haven't seen her?l've seen so many.On top of it, she acted in a TV series.That depresses me.l hear she refused to speak her lines.Wasn't she fired?That counts for something these days.True.l'll make an effort.Don't have a photo on you?She wouldn't give us one.l don't seek, l find.Most people have the gutsto live their life,but not to imagine it.So how l can do it for them?Two years ago l met someone.l didn't tell you, did l?Not very attractive,but she dared speak her mind.l wonder what became of her.What's your definition of an adult?She really had something to sayabout the State.And the impossibility of the Statefalling in love.Actually, l'm dreaming.What'd l like is someonelike Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt.A shame you gave up your cantata.- Was the music the problem?- lt was me.Know what she earns as a waitress?3000 or 4000 francs.She also works elsewhere.When they earn morethan 10,000 francs a month,the French let themselvesbe led by the nose.- Don't you agree, Philippe?- l don't know, sir.The strangest thing isthe living dead of this worldare modeled on the world as it was.The way they think and feelcomes from before.So, did you find the line?''Jeanne, what a strange pathled me to you.'' But l'm not sure.l'll check the bookshop.l was right. She's workingat a railroad depot tonight.Things are right in front of us.Why make them up?We're looking for a girlwith big eyes who works here.Go see the girls outside.You again? l said no.- You're killing yourself.- lt's my business.Maybe not.How are you, otherwise?l have work to do. Leave me alone.And how are you?l'm fine.How'd it go with the Americans?Which Americans?The Americans of North America.You have some memory.l think l do.Too much of it, even.l wouldn't know.lt's no longer my business.Can we talk a minute?Please.Can't you see l'm working?So am l.l can wait.l noticed an Arab restaurant.lt was still open.l'll wait for you there.No, l said.l have to clean offices after this.We can give you a lift.l don't want you to.Next week, then.You must have a day off.l have to drive my son to Dijon.So long. lt's all right.l want to discuss a project.Maybe better than that.Sure, but l already said no.You prefer never?- What did she say?- Maybe.When young people break up,things become incomprehensible.Take them.They're at the pool.She watches him swimwith a girlfriend.She shivers.Why doesn't he love her now?''You didn't get my letter?'' he asks.''l don't understand it.''''But it's simple enough.''l love you so much, you're so present,''you're so real for me''it's useless to see youas you'll always be there,''whatever happens.''She tugs anxiously on her necklace.lt breaks.The beads fall into the pool.He dives in and brings one back.He says something else.She cries.''Why run after somethingyou have already?''ln a word, you're too lovelyto be desired,''and l placed you too highfor you to satisfy me.''l love you, you're mine.''But since you're minel don't have to see you.''You see what's going on?And you?Could you say thatto the person you love?Would you accept itfrom someone you love?That's why Eglantineand Perceval broke up.We'll wait 5 more minutes.You have time?Someone said that two years ago.l remembered it, but not clearly.Once, at a book stalll found the text.lt's a short novel by Georges Bataille.You heard of him?On the Spanish Civil Warpeople always cite ''Man's Hope,''never ''Blue of Noon.''True, it came out after the Liberation.l think it sold 300 copies.- Philippe, do it with him?- Yes, sir.''Love of a mortal being.''You say love,''but the antithesis of the loved one''is the State,''whose role negatesthe sovereign value of love.''The State has not, or has lost,the power to embracethe world in its totality.''This totality of the universeoffered both''in the beloved, as an object,''and in the lover,as the subject.''This is no good.Why not?l told you why.There's no such thing as an adult.Do you ever think about death?l mean, your own death?Then you haven't made a will?A man was executed at the Liberation50 years ago.He wrote this the night before.Read it to us.''ln Year 35 of my years,Like Villon, a prisoner.''- ''Like Cervantes...''- That won't do.Learn how to read, ma'am. Or recite.Or learn how to listen.lsn't that so, Philippe?l didn't say, look.l said, listen.Hear.''ln the awkward scrawl of these pages''l begin my last will and testament.''By court order, my worldly goods''And heritage they'll take from me.''That's easy, l had neither''Land or money in my patrimony.''As for my books and images''Let them be dispersed to the wind.''Neither tenderness nor courage''Are things a court can rescind.The minister gave his green light.Thank you, counselor.Strolling or working?We're going to a talk on Kosovo.Mark Hunter just came back from there.You've been following this business?A little.And the young lady, Edgar?We went to see her. Not great.She's no Berthe Morisot.You knew l'd met her before?Two years back, on the coast.''l knew how history would be told.''The Serbs committed horrors''in their frightful persecution''of the Albanians of Kosovo.''No journalist notedthat most of the refugees''were in their homeswhen the war broke out''and that the Serbs warnedthey'd settle the Albanians' score''if NATO attacked Yugoslavia.''''l recognize their fear.''The radio said that the Serbshad the right to kill at will.''Even women, children and old people.''But l cannot hide my shame at learning''that for the first time in our history''we, the Albanians of Kosovo,''are equally capable of actsjust as monstruous.''Your nationality?l have none.Kurd, but stateless.l'm from Madrid.There are good Americans, too.Mark left his countryduring the Reagan era.There can be no resistancewithout memory or universalism.''No peace without justice,''it was said at Sarajevo.What do we do?We're stupid.The American accent's awful.You wanted America, you got it.Not me, l didn't ask for anything.And your parents, in 1944?And your grandparents, in 1918?What are you talking about?Nothing. lt's history.He's looking for someoneto edit his bookand correct the proofs.There can be no resistancewithout memoryor universalism.lsn't it strange how historyhas been replaced by technology?But why politics by gospel?The church is in step with time.Drop Mr Forlaniat the lntercontinental.lf you don't object, Paul,part of your feeswill be paid in kind.What do you mean?Weren't you lookingfor a Balzac edition?Absolutely.''A Harlot High and Low.''The 1844 edition.Where did you find it?Better than the original.The living copy. Living.''She had hair''that no coiffeur's hand could hold,so thick was it,''and so long that it fellto the floor in rings.''Living Esther, Paul.- A Jewess?- As only Raphael could draw them!The church is in step with time.Like troops movingthrough unfamiliar territorywhere normal provisioningis impossible.How can it bequeath to the meek,the legitimate heirs of God,a kingdom not of this world?You never think of it,but the truth may turn out to be sad.What are you after?With me?l have papers to sign.''Here peace officer Revelwas shot by the Germans...''l don't understand the lawyers.l need people for this project.l don't like that world.Same here.l'm full of doubts.- Shall we walk?- l walk home anyway.You'll tire before me.They shouldn't phrase it like that.Neither ''officer'' nor ''peace''nor ''Germans.''People often say somethingin a discussion.They don't agree, so they say,''And you? What are you doing here?''The other answers,''That's another story.''But they never tell that other story.They never start from there.Maybe because it has to be toldanother wayand they haven't the guts.That's what happened to my parents.They committed suicide.l don't know about Mother,but my father left a letter.He never said ''globalization.''He said ''the universal stage.''l was 5 years old.l was born 3 years before May '68.What are you thinking about?The empty fortress.That sounds familiar.l was thinkingof the Communist trade union.There is no emptiness.There's always a voice somewhere.What about silence?Even in silence.- What about death?- There is no death.When it comes, there's alwaysa sense of self.When l said ''empty fortress,''l was actually thinkingof workers' struggles.And the ephemeral.We haven't really discussedyour project.lt keeps jumping the track.But which track?The one from childhood to old age.You referring to adulthood?lf you want.Am l wrongor you don't have children?You're right. l live alone.And you?l have a 3-year-old boy.After you got married?My boyfriend left me.Since our breakup,and when l think about it,and only then,things start making sense.What you're saying is interesting.Things beginning,things coming to an end.Not your story or mine,but, whatever happens, our story.Even if we aren't acquainted.History.When we met in Brittanyand talked a bit,you had nothing to sayabout what was going on.Even if it didn't concern you.How you really felt.The principle of it, l mean.l think you were right.- Americans have no real past.- Those in the north.Not the Mexicans. Not Brazil.Yes, the Americans of the north.They have no memory of their own.Their machines do,but they have none personally.So they buy the past of others.Especially those who resisted.Or they sell talking images.But an image never talks.That's what they want.l agree with you.When l think about something,l'm really thinking of something else.You can only think about somethingif you think of something else.For instance,you see a landscape new to you.But it's new to youbecause you mentally compare itto another landscape,one which you know.ls that Auteuil over there?Way down there.lt was near the Mirabeau Bridge,in 52 B.C.,that Caesar's generalcrossed the Seineinto the Grenelle plain to attackthe Gallic troops of Lutetia.There was forest there, all round.What remains todayis the Bois de Boulogne.''Drancy Future''Who ever connected Drancywith the future?Oh, some upright family man.He came home from the office,kissed his childrenand told his little girlhe'd worked well.You're right.The truth may turn out to be sad.l'll lend you a book on the subject.No, l won't tell you where l live.At the bookshop.They hold on to my mail.Why don't you talkabout your project anymore?l'm not right for it now.l'm not beautiful enough.l think, though, that you think so.My grandfather, 3 years ago...You asked why he stillbelonged to the Communist Party.He would never say ''women,''he would say, ''persons of sex.''Good, l made you laugh.Yes, true.We can never knowwhat a thought is all about.You win. l was smiling.Say it again, slowly?''Every thought''should recall''the debris''of a smile.''l hope so.Goodbye.After your meetingwith Jean Lacouture,l left, too.l never kept in touch.l took the same train you did.l figured l shouldn't stop them.No, just things.Things just.Not very cheerful here.Happiness is never cheerful.You didn't make that up.No, sir. lt was Max Ophuls.Come on. You, mister.- ''l think: lf He came back...- ''Who?''You know who. The Galilean hobo.''The redhead with a heartlarger than life.''lf the spotless lamb returned...''They're waiting for us.And Edgar?He's here.And they say Daumier isn't a painter.So you dropped the play idea.Yes, too much shouting.Remember what you said to me?Nothing is lost now but our honor.So, the honor is yours, sir.- What must l do?- You just say, ''Go on.''So Eglantine and Perceval met again.What are you doing here?A friend.We were visiting Mr Rosenthal.How's he been?Since you left he's let himself go.His memory's going.And you, how are you?l'm fine, now.l've taken up boxing again,and my cantata.lt's turning into an opera.''Joy of Man's Desiring.''That's right.l heard you got married.You must be joking.True, in time she became pathetic.You know how things go, l think.Every thought should recalla capsized smile.- Where'd you hear that phrase?- Nowhere.l just made it up.Philippe, the days of phrases are over.- How's she been?- l'm about to find out.l have an appointment next door.- Good luck.- Yes, sir.ls that Edgar?Why call him ''sir''?He's younger than you.Maybe, but he's the only persontrying to become an adult.We got a letter from Amsterdam.They have people therewho help others end it all.You know about her parents,don't you?Yes, she told me.Recently?Or when you came that time?Recently.She was working here?We were only toldshe still had some things here.And that she wanted to leave youone of her books.Take your pick.How did you get my address?She didn't have it.Apparently, she did.You shouldn't have droppedthat project.She told you about it?Early last fall.We'd had no news for 3 years.She believed in it, you know.That's no reason to commit suicide.Maybe it's none of my business,but how'd it go with those Americans?No, it's none of your business.There was also her tuberculosis.l didn't know.She hid it, like her mother did.What about her little boy?Did you know her well?l don't even know her name.Or yours.At your hotelwe hardly talked 10 minutes.Not much more when we met again.Her tone of voice interested me.lt often brought ideas to life.As for the rest...she was a letdown.- l'll take this one.- You're the letdown.Good luck.What luck?TWO YEARS EARLlERYou're Edgar?You've come to see Jean Lacouture.He asked me to fetch you.l'm in charge of culture for the city.You're writing on Catholicsin the Resistance.lt's just a study.l have some interesting records.My great-uncle left many papers.''Memoirs of a Free France Agent''And all the ''Confr?riede Notre-Dame'' archives.Actually, l'm composing a cantata.A cantata for Simone Weil.l wonder if they'rewho l think they are.- Who do you mean?- Pain-in-the-ass Americans.As P?guy saidon June 17, 1940:''ln war, l side with he who won't''surrender the citadel.''Catholics and the Resistance.But right now l'm doingbackground research.l'm writing a cantatafor Simone Weil.You know what she saidabout the Bible?That it wasn't a theory about Godbut a theory about Man.Do you think the people in Londonpondered those things?Christianity is definitely partof the spirit of resistance.There's that dimensionthat was experiencedamong French resistance fighterson home soil.Look, half of Shakespeareis set in France.Can this war be saidto have been a religious war?One of drama's great love scenesis in ''Henry V,''when the French princesslearns a few words of English.The most erotic ones.l think, if the Catholicsand the monarchistswere generally the firstto go to London,it's because they originallycame from there.We were coming out ofa totally strange period...Stay two more days.To see the two Resistance veteranswho sold their memory to Hollywood.What's going on?Berthe looked at the contract.We've been had.Are you quite sure?You can always negotiate.She's crazy.We had to close the restaurant.What if we have to return the money?Winter's coming.What does Fran?oise think?l'll do what she wants.Who's that guy with the bag?A student working on de Gaulleand the Catholics.Tragedy is convenient.lt runs on its own.Death, despair, and betrayalare on the march,and the storms, the tears,the stillness, all stillness...Tragedy is clean.lt is restful.With melodrama, with its traitorsand wicked villains,A LONG TlME AGOits avengers,its glimmers of hope,death becomes horrible,like an accident.ln tragedy, there's no problem.First, we're among friends.We're all innocent, in short.60 years ago,l crossed the Channel in that thing.- The sad hope...- Free France.We're trapped,finally trapped.We rebuilt it identically.You're right:when the fact becomes legend,print the legend.And who's the gentleman?Why Washington?What's he talking about?They're saying that trade follows films.What should we do?We'll think it over, l'm taking notes.You think it over.We'll talk again.Basically,the Resistance hadits youth...And it had its old age...but it never went through adulthood.Who's to decide if your pastis alive or not?lt depends on how you see yourself.Someone who plansto keep moving aheaddefines his former selfas a self that no longer exists.But some people's planimplies rejecting time.They have a strong bondwith the past.lt's true of almost all old people.They can't abide timefor fear of wasting away.Each clings to the convictionthat he is unchanging.But to what extent does memoryhelp us reclaim our lives?l can't find the tapethat you recorded...''The Secret War.''ls that you, during the war?ls that you, there?That one is when lntelligenceasked me to work for the Gestapo.Many people died because of that.l was acquitted twice.l remained a Communist,so they said l was a Russian spy.True, l knew someonein the Orchestre Rouge.And who's that?You just said hello to her.lt was an amateur opera production.Berthe was 19 years old.A fabulous swimmer, too.Then...- she fell ill and quit.- And now?She works in a Paris law firm.A LONG TlME AGOThat was with my wife at the beachin '45.We thought it was starting.ln fact, it was ending.l realize that it takes- 50 years for it to end.- lt skips over the parentsand it lands on the grandchildren.Maybe you're right:Adulthooddoesn't exist.We can't go on discussing for hours.Let me start again:''Our company, Spielberg Associates,''has acquired the right,signed by Mrs Bayarde...''Bayard!''Mrs Bayard here present...''By this agreement''that Mr Bayard has also signed,''our company has

writerto do the screenplay.You say ''American writer.''What ''Americans'' do you mean?South America?The United States, of course.Of course,but Brazil's states are united, too.ln Brazil they're called Brazilians.No, l said the United Statesof North America.The United Mexican Statesare N. America,and they're Mexicans.ln Canada they're called Canadians.Which united states do you mean?l just said:the United States of the North.Well, then,an inhabitant of your united states,what's he called?See? You don't have a name.This man signed for a countrywhose inhabitants have no name.No wonder they needother peoples' stories,other peoples' legends.You're like us.You're looking for the origin:parents, siblings, cousins...Nothing original about that.But we seek it inside ourselves.Poor you! With no history,you have to seek it elsewhere,in Vietnam, Sarajevo...Okay, but you can do it gently...Nicely.Know the origin of the word ''OK''?One of your generals,during the Civil War,used it in his report:- ''0 killed.''- Let me finish.The first check for 50,000 USDwas remitted as agreed on signature.This check was cashed two days later.Nude scenes!So we see no reason to rework- the present agreement.- They didn't notice.Today, in all filmsgirls must undressand roll all over their lovers.Was that reallyyours and grandpa's story?Mrs Schindler was never paid.She's in poverty in Argentina.Don't stay outside.l'm looking for a videotapegrandpa recorded.lt shows terrible things:the guilty's gaze on the innocent.SO LONG AGOYou say ''State,''but the State is the very antithesisof the image of a loved one,whose sovereign reasonnegates that of love.Thank you, Father,for showing the babeswhat you hid from the wiseand the intelligent.Listen to this:''October '45.'' lt's still true.''Today,''August 20, 1945,''in this deserted and starving Paris,''the war has ended,''peace has not yet begun.''And this...''But we're back in the Year 1000.''Each day is the eveof the end of time,''the eve of the daywhen our honesty and courage''will no longer have meaningfor anyone.''''Henceforth my freedom is purer.''And this...''But we, born in France,what can we say?''lt's not much to sayit is our homeland. lt's vague.''lt's our concrete situation,''our chance, and our fate.'' 'Until now, l lived in fear,'said Tristan Bernard''when they came to arrest him,'' 'From now on, l will live in hope.' ''Tristan Bernard is the one who said''lf you can see Le Havre, it will rain.- ''lf you can't see it anymore...- ''...lt's raining.''- How's it going downstairs?- You should've come.ALREAD Y TWO YEARS EARLlERl want to tell you something.You wanted to say something?When did the gaze collapse?10 years ago?15 years?Maybe 50.Before TV.Who knows?Be more precise.Before TVtook precedence.Over what?Over current events?Over life.Yes.l feel our gaze has becomea program under control.Subsidized.The image, sir,alone capable of denying nothingness,is also the gaze of nothingness on us.l hope not.What bothers me is notsuccess or failure.lt's the reams and reamswritten about it.So it's the literature that bothers you.Not necessarily,but why bother saying or writingthat ''Titanic'' is a global success?Talk about its contents.Talk about things,but don't talk around things.Let's talkon the basis of things.- Did you see it?- No, not yet.l may agree to some extent.At Marrakesh, they discussedthe fate of the world.ln fact, they use othersto talk of themselves.lt's deadly, you're right.They confuse existence with life.ls that it?l'm no philosopherbut in my opinion, yes.Look at a cell.There's a nucleus of an atom, as well.lt's the basis of existence.Around it is life.They treat life like a whorewhich they use to improvetheir existence.The extraordinaryto improve the ordinary.That's right.One can enjoy existence, not life.Exactly.l didn't quite follow their discussions.This business about a film.What do the grandmotherand her husband want?Jean wants money to save the hotel.l don't know about her.l think she wants to be starlike she was 60 years ago.The Tristan networkwas an ugly business.The English weren't very ''orthodox.''He turned her in under orders.No one knows what either of themknew of the other.- l know.- You know nothing at all.Then l can guess.So they got married?When she returned from Ravensbr?ck.ln the campshe met Genevi?ve de Gaulle.She embraced Catholicism.That's right.Heaven and Earth shall pass.My words shall not pass.For 4 years,during the organized Resistance,money was reduced to a means.No longer an end.Listening to your music?''Spiegel im spiegel.''What's that mean?''The mirror in the mirror.''lt's late.Where were you?With Godfather and the maninterviewing him.Did l go overboard this morning?That's your business, sweetie.True, l'm ignorant about movies.Godfather told meto give you this book.What is it?Robert Bresson,''Notes on the Cinematograph.''Listen to this...''Director:''lt's not a questionof directing someone''but of directing oneself.''And this...''Be sure to exhaustwhat can be communicated''by stillness and silence.''And this...''Let feelings bring about events,''not the contrary.''You and Grandpa made a decision.ls it for the money?lf it goes through, what's it for?Obviously anything l can sayis pointless.What are you thinking about,Grandma?When l was in the U.S. and theyasked me, the young French student,to speak about wartime Franceand the concentration camps,l think l did so without any trouble.l always rattled off the same memories.People reacted like they do nowin front of their TV sets.My words weren't heartfelt.Want to hear the record again?You know,there's a questionl never dared ask you.Nor Grandpa.Why did you keep your code name,and not your real one?My name is Samuel.Dad's was, too.Why do you still call yourself Bayard?During the war, sure, but afterward?l'm going to bed.Every desire must meet its lassitude,its truth.We're all jesters.We outlive our problems.Action and reaction,the oldest couple in history.You told the Americans that?And also that we originatedour search for origins.And that wasthe Resistance's originality.- You said that?- And that l held to P?guy's plan:Not to relax too soon.l'm also thinking about love.Courtly love.They say it was the Frenchbut it went on at court,the court of the king of England,Henry ll.Essentially in Anjou,in Normandy,in the duchy of Aquitaine.Alienor was his wife.Again, the originality of modern Franceis defined by its origins.ln any case,its highly original ties with England...Hence,perhaps, despite what everyone says,with America as well.England is the refugefor everything that isresistance to revolution.The England of Pitt and Burke,yes, it's natural.The ties are historical, geographic,and political.Brittany, Great Britain. There's a tie.l'll see what l can do.A petition to dub ''Matrix''into Breton.lmage and sound are vital to History,and most importantis that basic element:not knowing how History will end.You're not very talkative.l'm going through a hard time.l broke up with my girlfriend.We'd been together for 10 years.lt's strange, in fact,how things take on meaningwhen the story ends.lt's because History is coming in.With a big H.The fairy struck the frogwith her wandand suddenly the princess appeared.The preterit creates a present image.Every problem defiles a mystery.ln turn, the problem is defiledby its solution.lt's not by chance.What do you mean?There's the service entranceand the main entrance.They use the latterfor the apartment of the worldand leave usthe service entrance, sir.Words.Through our use of speech,we come to realize how wordspresent us with ideas.Man manufactures ideas.He is an intrepid maker of ideas.A current condition resultsfrom this faculty, Miss.Do you know that sayingby Saint Augustine:''The measure of loveis to love without measure''?l'm thinking about something.When l think about something,in fact,l'm thinking of something else.You can only think about somethingif you think of something else.For instance,l see a landscape that is new to mebut it's new to mebecause l mentally compare itto another landscape,an older one,one that l knew.''Thus everything in my story wanes.''As l am left with only imagesof what happened so quickly,''l will go down to the Elysian Fields''with more shades than a manhas ever taken''with him.''And then these guys arrive.Then she writes something.And if you were to be asked,if you had the choice:film, play, novel,or opera, which would you chose?We have a project.lt relates something of the history...And this somethingis one of the moments...And the first moment.Do you remember the names?Maybe nothing was said.Maybe nothing was said.
