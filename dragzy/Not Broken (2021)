tocall you at home.(sighs) Is this anokay time to talk?It's Winter.I just...We're having a hard timewith pretty muchall of her homework.Could you give me an idea ofhow she's doing in the class?Actually, I've been meaningto schedule aconference with you.Winter is fallingbehind in every subject.Except for art, that is.Oh.I guess that's what Ithought I would hear.What, what can I do?I think it would be wiseof you to get Winter tested.I can recommend aneuropsychologist if you'd like.Okay.All right.I'll send you a text withhis contact information.In the meantime, I'll work oncreating some accommodationfor her in the classroom.That should take someof the pressure off.Okay.Ms. Mason, do youhave other studentsthat you create specialaccommodations for?Never mind.Thank you.[Ms. Mason] You'remore than welcome.Have a good night.How does soup sound?Sounds good."Sprinkle beef withsalt and pepper."Place one tablespoon..."(clatters)Wait, how are you doing that?[Winter] The wordsaren't jumping around.I didn't know that they did.[Winter] Neither did I, Ijust thought it was normal.[Olivia] Let's see...[Winter] "Sing, sing,what shall I sing?"The world is fullof wonderful things."Upside down, huh?You can read upside down.Hold on."Once upon a time, there wasa family who lived together"in a little house in a wood."Honey, I don'tunderstand this.I don't know what's happening.Babe, you can read.Do you, do you knowwhat this means?How was the book, honey?It was great.What was your favorite part?I don't remember.Well, what was the book about?I don't remember.It must not have beenvery interesting then.But I really loved it.Well, do you rememberanything about it?No.Honey, I think you're tired.I'm not, I'm juststupid and you know it.Don't ever say that.Okay?Why not?It's the truth.Winter.Don't worry aboutthe book, okay?I want you to get agood night's sleep.You have a big day ahead of you.Good night, honey.(book thuds)- Hey, Winter.- Hey, Sage.Is that a new hat?I don't think I'veseen it before.Yeah, I got it for Christmas.It's so cute.Thanks.So you ready foryour spelling test?You're kidding, right?I've flunked every spellingtest I've ever taken.You know, I've heard thatdoctors are terrible spellers.Well, maybe it's just theirpenmanship that's bad.Anyway, did I tellyou I was going to bein the spelling bee?No, you didn't mention it.Yeah, I'll be competingagainst the sixthgraders this year.Cool.Sorry, I didn't mean to brag.I don't even want to be inthe stupid spelling bee.My dad's making me.In fact, I'd rather scrubtoilets, come to think of it.Come on, Winter,the bus is here.(engine rumbling)Winter, we've gotta go!(slow music)Winter!Honey.What are you doing out here?You had me worried.Another bad day at school?I hate school.I want to quit.No.Honey, you can't quit school.That'd be like Dadquitting his job.But that would be good 'causethen we could see him more.Hey, can we talkabout this in the car?You're already latefor your appointment.What appointment?Did you forget?We're going to go and meetthe neuropsychologist.But I don't want to.It won't be that bad.I promise.Come on.Hi, Dr. Newman.Yeah, I haven't actually hada chance to look it over,but I have it.I can bring you up to speed.I got the findings right here.Basically, in a nutshell,your daughter isprofoundly dyslexic.She also has moderateattention deficit disorderand her processingspeed is extremely low.On a positive note though,she has extremely high IQ.In addition to that,her fine motor skillsare off the chart.Although that won't help heracademically, her IQ will.Okay.So what are yourrecommendations?Our recommendationsare pretty clear.We feel that sheshould transfer schoolsto a school with a reallygood special needs program.I would also recommend thatwe start her on Adderall,in addition to...[Olivia] I'm sorry, I just...You lost me at Adderall.I...You want me to put mynine-year-old on a stimulant?Mrs. Knight, withall due respect,she can either be alawyer or a lunch lady.Frankly, it's your choice.You've certainly givenme a lot to think about.Thank you.(paper rustling)Hi.What are you doing in here?What's Addenall, Mom?Addenall?Adderall.Were you eavesdropping?I heard you talking about me.I'm sorry.I was going over your testresults with Dr. Newman.You got a second?I suppose.Well, they confirmedwhat I already knew.And that is, you area very bright girl.There's just a fewlearning challengesthat we need to address.Dr. Newman believes you'dbenefit from special education.But everyone wouldmake fun of me.No, they wouldn't.You're going to be in acompletely different building.If you don't want peopleto know, no one will know.Don't make me leaveSage, Mom, please.Babe, you can seeSage after school.You can have her over tothe house whenever you want.Besides, you're going tobe making new friends,friends who are your age,friends who have yourown same abilities.You mean disabilities.Winter, Dr.Newman is an expertand he wants you to succeed.I trust his judgment.Well, I think it's thestupidest idea I've ever heard.I'm not asking youfor your opinion.I'm transferring you on Monday.Go ahead, but you'll be sorry.(kids chattering)Did you see that girl?She's reading herbook upside down.[Girl] Yeah, I noticed,it's kind of weird.She's probably illiterate.[Girl] What's that?[Girl] It meansshe can't read.Are you okay?Never been better.Something's wrong.Come on, Winter.You know you cantell me anything.It's just that theywere making fun of me.[Sage] For what?For reading upside down.Why were youreading upside down?I always do.I read better that way.Seriously, Winter, I alwaysknew you were a genius.You're a modern dayLeonardo Da Vinci.What are you talking about?Haven't you heard of Da Vinci?He just happens to be themost famous artist ever.Of course I've heard of him.My point is, he wroteeverything in mirror image.He probably readupside down too.People say his dyslexiais what fueled his genius.Really?I had no idea.Sage, the bus.Come on, let's go.Sorry, I can't.I don't understand.I'll tell you later.Bye.(slow music)(knocking)(door creaking)What are you doing on my roof?(dog barking)Well, I've got todo my homework.Do you have any art supplies?[Sage] Sure, what do you need?Just some colored pencils.Okay, give me a second.Thanks.She's right here, one minute.Hey, Mom, it's for you.- Oh, thanks, honey.- You're welcome.Hello?Oh, hi, Olivia.Is everything okay?No, we haven't seen her.Oh, Olivia.Oh, I can't imagine whatyou're going through.If there's anythingwe can do to help,please, don't hesitate to ask.Thank you.(door creaking)Sage, Winter's missing.We have to help find her.Come on, hurry up, let's go.[Sage] We're inbig trouble now.(helicopter whirring)(siren wailing)Winter?(phone ringing)Hello?Hey, Lisa.What?Hi, Kelly, this is Kris.I just got off thephone with Oliviaand I guess Winter didn'tshow up to school today.Since you're her babysitter,I just thought youmight have some leads.Hey, Jennifer, we got to go.Hey, I'll call you later.(slow music)When's the lasttime you saw her?When we were at the bus stop.[Girl] What was she wearing?I don't remember.[Woman] Did you talk to her?Uh-uh.[Man] Are you sureshe didn't say anything?[Sage] Nope.[Woman] Winter?Winter!Winter!Winter!Winter!(siren wailing)Come on.But we didn't find her!I'm exhausted.(door creaks)[Sage] Good night, Winter.(Olivia crying)Oh no!No!No.(siren wailing)Oh no.No, no, no!(knocking)Excuse me, ma'am,is there supposed to be akid's shoes on your roof?What?(Olivia crying)Winter, I need you tolisten very carefully.What you did lastnight was really wrongand it brought distress notonly on me and your motherand the Petersons, but reallyon the entire community.And you were complicit, Sage.You should've known betterthan to go alongwith a deception.Your mother and I arevery disappointed.What do you girls haveto say for yourselves?I knew it was wrongbut I did it anyway.I don't know whatI was thinking.I'm so sorry.I'm sorry too.I'll never do itagain, I promise.I think we're all veryheartened to hear this,but what you did wasreally quite severeand it's essential thatthere be consequencesfor your actions.And your mom and Ihave talked about itand the consequencesfor this are that,effective immediately,you are not to see Sagefor an entire month.You have our fullsupport, Charles.[Sage's Dad] We'll see to itthat Sage complieswith your request.I really hope you girlshave learned a lesson.(slow music)(Olivia sighs)[Winter] Mom, I'm home!I'm in your room, sweetie.[Winter] What are you doing?I'm just organizingyour things, honey.[Winter] Thank you?Have you ever heard thedefinition of insanity?I don't know, maybe.It's doing the samething over and over again,expecting different results.So?I'm kicking myself, honey.I should've done this years ago.I think it's time wepull you out of school.Really?Yeah.Except that theoperation is subtraction.Look at this example.Have you looked at this already?Um, no.No?To accomplish good.He initiated many reforms,such as greater conservationof natural resourcesand better food inspection law.The president shall be commanderin the chief of the Armyand Navy of the United Statesand of the militia ofthe several states.When called into the actualservice of the United States,he may require...Winter.Honey, are you listening?(thumps)How is this anydifferent than school?Can't we agreethis isn't working?When am I even goingto use any of this?Why can't I do somethingmeaningful for a change,like get a job?Maybe then I'll startretaining what I learn.That makes me nervous.What makes you nervous?Setting aside academics.It's always the academicsfor you, isn't it?All the money you pouredinto vision therapists,tutors, special diets,special programs.And for what?Why can't we stopfixating on what's brokenand start figuringout what I'm good at?Maybe then I'll stopbeing such a loser!Okay.I think it's time we startto work on your resume.Hello?Yes, this is Winter.That would be great.Mm-hmm.I'm totally free.Yeah, thank you.I'll see you then.Bye.What was that?[Winter] I justgot a job offer.That's wonderful.I think my

frustrating.[Woman] Yeah, I don'tknow what's happened.[Woman] You must be Winter.Yes.I have my work.Impressive, Winter.(sighs)Um, truly abstract andmodern is what works for us.(door closes)(doorbell rings)[Girl] Hey, where's Blake?He's parking the car.[Girl] Oh, haveyou met my cousin?I don't think I have.[Girl] Let me introduce you.She did what!?I know![Olivia] Winter?Whatever happened to the

Mom.(dramatic music)(birds cawing)Margaret?Emily?No, I'm sorry.It's me, Winter.God has sent me an angel.Would you get me aglass of water, darling?I'm awfully thirsty.Of course.Here.Thank you.I'm so glad you're here.I think I've had a stroke.Do you need me to call 911?They're on their way.Would you read me a littlefrom my Bible, please?It's such a comfort, Winter."For this light momentaryaffliction is preparing us"an eternal weight of glorybeyond all comparison,"as we look not to thethings that are seen,"the things that are unseen."For the things thatare seen are transient."But the things thatare unseen are eternal."(slow music)(knocking)Come in!Hi, you must be Winter?[Winter] Yes,and you're Emily.I am, welcome.My mom left you a few things.You obviously meanta great deal to her.Thank you.I'll be right back.[Winter] "Dearest Winter,"I'm leaving you mygreatest earthly treasure."Within its pages, may youfind the unconditional love"you've been seeking."So I was goingthrough her thingsand I came across this.You're the artist, I'm assuming.Yes, I drew that for her.I don't know if you know this,but I'm an art curator by tradeand I recognizetalent when I see it.This is good work.Thank you.(knocking)[Emily] Hi there,I'm looking for Winter.May I ask your name?[Emily] Sure, I'm Emily.I'm an art curator and I'mhoping to see some of her work.Okay.Hi, Winter, how are you?Good.Good.I hope it's all rightthat I've stopped by.I found your addressin the phone book,thought I would just drop inand check out someof your artwork.Oh.Actually, I recently losta lot of my work in a fire.That's terrible.Regardless, I'd love to featurea piece of yours in a show.There's a showcoming up in a week.Do you think you'd beable to handle that?I assume thatinvolves compensation.[Emily] Yes, whenit sells, absolutely.And I don't think I'll haveany trouble doing that.Well, in that case,she's very interested.(birds cawing)How's your masterpiececoming along?Still waiting forinspiration to strike.You haven't even started?No.Well, what inspires you?People who perseverethrough great challenges.Can you push me?I can't leave Alejandra,sweetie, I'm so sorry.I have to be going anyway.- Alejandra!- Winter![Winter] Can I drawa picture for you?Sure.Thank you so much.All right, what'syour favorite animal?Robin.A robin?All right, I thinkI can do that.(gentle music)I knew you could do it.It's amazing.You must be very proud of her.We are, most certainly are.Great show.Tell me when she got started.[Mr. Knight] You know,she started making artwhen she was two.Is everything all right?Yeah.There's a gentleman over here,he's interested inbuying your art.(gentle music)Coming down offthe high already?I'm just thinking.About what, honey?It's just...It's hard to throw myheart into somethingthat I know you disapprove of.I see now thatdiscouraging youfrom pursuing yourdreams was wrong.I'm so sorry.If you knew anythingof my childhood,perhaps you'd understand.I don't know anythingabout your childhood.That's because I wastoo ashamed to tell you.Your grandfather wasan artist like you.Only he never managedto get a following.He tried to supportyour grandmother and I,but he could barelypay the bills.Then he started drinkingand we lost everything.We were homeless for afew years after that.I had no idea.Well, regardless,it was wrong of meto have projected myfather's failures onto you.It's just that I love you somuch, I don't want you to...I never doubtedyour love, Mom.Just always thoughtit was conditional.Winter.How could you ever forgive me?I already have.This is for you.[Alejandra] It's special.Just like you.So how's the caregiving going?Actually, I think I'velearned more from Alejandrain the past few months than Iever learned in a classroom.How so?Imagine if all thesealpacas were the same.Same color, same characteristics,same personality traits.[Sage] That'd bepretty monotonous.I've realizedthat our differencesdon't diminish our value.That's what makes us special.It took me 18 years,but I think I'm finallyokay with who I am.Just okay?Hey, Winter, how's it going?Good.Thank you.Actually, I'venever been better.♪ I know that I don'tbring a
