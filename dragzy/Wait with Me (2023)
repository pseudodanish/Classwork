I'm in deep.This is so desperate.It doesn't matter.What matters is that I'vegot my writing mojo backand I'm not giving it up.Please?Why don't you justfind a back entranceinstead of borrowingevery neighbor's car?You never thought of that?This deadline has mefreaked out, okay?No, whatever.- Wait...- Thank you!You don't need my car?Nope!Shit!Are you okay?Oh, my God, my computer.Okay, it's not cracked,but will it boot?Oh, rookie mistake.This is what I getfor not backing it up.Oh, okay.

That isluxury-reclaimed barn wood.This is about your exwho happens tostill live with you.He's gone for the summer.That is hardly living together.And as soon as he getsback, I'm not budging.We're playing thisgame of chicken,and there's no way I'mletting that entitled fuckertake this house.So even though youcan't write in it,you want to fight forthe house with no vibe?That's irrelevant.There's no way inhell I'm moving.I have to write afollow-up bestseller.That is no small feat.I live next doorto my best friend.You don't want meto move out, do you?No.What?It looks like a letterfrom Tire Depot.They figured it out?Stop being so dramatic.Have they ever mailedyou something before?No. Oh, my God.

Not my vibe.And your vibe is this tire shop?You gotta see itto believe it, man.If you find your vibe somewhere,you have to fight for it.Tire Depot is to me whatFanny Braun was to John Keats.Poetry in motion, man.Okay, you sound like a lunatic.What if you could workbetter and faster elsewhere?You'd have more timeto hike, bang chicks,prank your friends, buymore plaid trousers.Oh, you've been noticingmy slacks, Kate?No, and don'tchange the subject.I feel like a fucking championwhen I'm blasting out wordsand sitting next to some galwho's wasting herlife on social media.It's a real morale boostfor Mercedes Lee Loveletter.And I still can't believeyou hit a best-seller listwith that pen name.My readers get me.They'd have to.So you're goingback there tomorrow?Hell's yeah.This smut won't write itself.I have two large pizzas,parmesan breadsticks,a pound of boneless wings,and three dipping sauces.Mercedes Lee Loveletter.I have two large pizzas,parmesan breadsticks,a pound of boneless wingsand three dipping sauces.Mercedes Lee Loveletter.I have two large pizzas,parmesan breadsticks,a pound of boneless wings,and three dipping sauces.Claim it now or it'sgoing in the trash.I'm Mercedes.I've been calling yourname for like five minutes.Well, I didn't order a pizza.I don't care.Fucking whore.I'm trying tokeep a low profile.Everyone is staring at me.I'm fucking mortified.Laughing so fucking hard.You interrupted my anal scene.I was in the zone.Wheezing on the floor.How do you have time for this?Don't you have a book to write?Best 53 bucks I ever spent.You're back.I had an issue withone of my tires.Which car?I drive the Cadillac SRX.A Cadillac?Isn't that kind ofan old lady car?It is not an old lady car.It is a luxury SUVand it is wonderful.Well, if you havethat kind of money,you should look intoa Lexus or a BMW.Much more sexy feel to the body.Maybe I don't wanta sexy body feel.What's your name?My name is Mercedes.That's perfect.You'd look damnfine in a Mercedes.What do you drive?An Indian motorcycle.Why am I not surprised?Am I that predictable?More predictablethan my old lady car.Well, it's nice to officiallymeet you, Mercedes.I'm Miles Hudson.Now tell me whyyou're really here.Would some leftoverpizza keep you quiet?I might buy you some time.Time is all I need.- You're serious?- Super serious.Very well, Mercedes.I'll leave you be, for now.See you around thewater cooler, Miles.You haven't noticedthat hot redheadin the comfort center, have you?Nope.Were she there today?Yeah, and yesterday.What was she doing?Just on her computer.So she's siphoning free Wi-Fi.Call the cops.

Youknow what I'm talking about?The heat.You might have to elaboratewith great detail.You asked for it.The heat of a woman is somuch more than temperature.It's her soft, sensual curves,the way that your fingers diginto the meat of her thighswhen she's wrapped around you.The delicate littlebumps on her ribcagewhen she's throwing herhead back in pleasure.Tight little nipples,and pillows of creamy softness.The fact that you couldfold your body around herand envelop her almost entirelyand still want more.That kind of heat.You totally write erotica.Damn it. I didn'twant you to know.Why not? What'sthe big secret?Because it'll change theway that you look at me.How so?You'll either think thatI'm some kind of sex freak,or you'll beembarrassed by what I doand not want to tell anyone.Are you joking?Well, your buddy doesn't count.He's probably a hornball.I mean anyone thatis important to you.It's a big reason whymy ex and I broke up.He asked me to lie to his familyabout what I did for a living.- What a fucker.- Yes.But I write somereally kinky shit.It's not exactly easy totell your grandma about.I would tell mygrandma about you.- You would not.- I fucking would.Grandmas hate me.My grandma hates me.She's really religious, andevery time that I come home,she tries to arrange for ameeting with me and her priest.She thinks that Ineed an interventionor an exorcism or something.I'm sorry, that's not funny.It's kind of funny.Come with me.- Where are we going?- Calling my grandma.No, Miles. Are you insane?- It's after midnight.- She loves me. I'm her favorite.Okay, okay. We'llcall my sister.Miles, what are you doing?Too late.Hello.Meg? I want to askyou a question.Why is it so loud?Miles, how is it possiblefor you to cock-block mefrom 500 miles away?Big brother intuition.Just ask your question.Okay, so I met this girl.She's super fucking hot.Gross, Miles.Sorry, okay.So she writes sexy books,like that's her job.Dirty kinky shit, I think.And she was saying thatgrandmothers hated her,and I said our grandmawould be totally into it.True or false?Duh, Grams is afreak. Totally true.So, who is this girl? Iwant to read her stuff.I'll find out.But I'll call you back, Meg.Don't fuck that dude tonight.What happened? What did I say?Mercedes, what are we doing?I don't know, I justkissed you, I guess.Yes, you did.And as hot as thatwas, we have to stop.Right, we're in public.I like you Mercedes, butI'm not in the positionto like someone right now.Wait, what?After everything that youjust said with your sister?Got it.Well, I'm sorry to put youthrough such adifficult situation.Mercedes, wait.I don't want things to be weird.Well, you shouldn't haveflirted with me then.See you around, Miles.Why are you here?Oh my God, what isthat horrible smell?It's nothing.Wait, wait, is that atire scented candle?No.Give it to me!Stop it, you're going to makeme spill wax on my floor!Let go so I can seewhat you're hiding.- No!- Kate!- No!- Hello.Don't stop on my account.Oh my God, burnt rubberscented soy candle.I can't believe this is a thing.Jesus, H, you got it bad, Kate.I know!Can't write a damn word,and all I want to do isgo back to Tire Depot.Then go.So you kissed him and heturned you down, big deal.What, are you inthe seventh grade?Go back to the Tire Depot.She has a point, Kate.It'll be awkward fora day, three tops.He'll probably stay inthe garage and ignore you.You're right.My house smellslike shit now, too.Fine. I'll go back.But only because burnt rubberis not the same as new rubber.We're rotating andbalancing tires.But the rattling soundthat you were hearingis, unfortunately...How's the book coming?Coming along.This is the point in the storywhere I rip the couple apartand ruin everything they thoughtthey knew about each other.Ouch.Can't they just be happy?What's dramatic about happy?My readers like thepain, the torture.Makes the makeup sexthat much better.You know, my sister texted me.She asked for your full authorname so she could look you up.Really?I warned you.We are a family full of readers.You're gonna laugh.I was drunk whenI came up with it.My full pen name isMercedes Lee Loveletter.What's your real last name?It's Smith.Also, I write a lot of BDSM.So does this mean wedon't have to be awkward?Yeah, friends.Good.Because as a friend,I was wonderingif you might be able to help mewith some researchfor my next book.What did you have in mind?You're gonna throwyour leg over,but don't let your anklestouch this area here.Got it?It'll make me feelbetter if you wear it.It'll protect you a little.Okay, get on.Okay, are you ready?Ready.Whoo!Ah!God, that was incredible.You weren't scared?No. Was I supposed to be?My ex hated this thing.Your ex is a fool.I mean, I understand thatmotorcycles are dangerous,but the danger is whatmakes it exciting.You took the wordsright out of my mouth.Unfortunately, my ex likeda different kind of danger.Do you want to tell mewhat you mean by that,or do you want tosay "word" again?My ex loved thecheating kind of danger.Yikes.It wasn't just one guy.That's the hardest part.How you can bald-faced lieto someone you care about?That's not the funkind of danger for me.Not at all.I'm so sorry.It's fine.I blame myself for notwalking away sooner.She made me a jealous headcase with baggage for days.Yeah. Jealousy is the worst.Although, I will tell you,from a writer's standpoint,readers love a possessive man.Is that right?So I should be thanking my exfor making me apossessive asshole?God, no.She sounds like toomuch of an assholeto get any credit forthe man you are today.Well, your ex soundedlike an asshole, too.I still can't believe hemade you lie about your job- to his family.- Right?Why did we ever date them?I ask myself that all the time.I guess you could say that ifwe didn't go through all that,then we might not be hereenjoying this awesome view.You're missing somethingreally beautiful.No, I'm not.I can't figure you out, Miles.I can't figure me out either.How's it going?No way.

Being an ass hat?I surround myself withpeople who are inclusiveand non-judgmental becauseI have a weird job.I don't want judgyfriends in my cornerbecause that wouldmake me a hypocrite.And Miles is so encouragingabout what I do.More encouraging thanyou have ever been.And he's not dumb at all.He's actually reallyfucking insightful.And you might seethat if you quitlooking down yournose at people.Don't go, Kate.No, I'm sorry.But if you're going tostart acting like this,then I don't see how wecan continue to be friends.Kate...I like you.Yeah, well, I liked you, too,until you started actinglike a douche nozzle.No. I mean, I really like you.- And I...- Shit.I don't think it's somethingI can ignore anymore.Dean...How long?A couple years.But I was with Lindsayand you were with thatdouchebag Dryston.Why didn't you tell me?I didn't want to be a rebound.You're hooking upwith a guy who stilldoesn't even knowyour real name.How do you thinkthat's going to end?He wants it casual, butI want the whole thing.The good, the bad, all of it.I'm sorry, Dean.But I just don'tfeel the same way.But you are oneof my best friendsand I don't want to change that.I need you to go.But why?We all have ourown little placesand this is my Tire Depot.Please.I'm sorry, Dean.Hey.What's that?A carburetor.What does it do?Um, kind of a lot.Do you really want to know?Yes.Well, it mixes the properratio of gas and airinside of an engine forcombustion to occur.Nowadays, most carshave fuel injectors,but the classics stillrun on these puppies.Interesting.It's kind of like how acandle needs oxygen to burn.Combustion of anengine can't take placewithout the air thecarburetor brings in.Kind of like how...an orgasm can't beachieved without friction.Sure. You coulddraw that parallel.I would like to drawthat parallel soon.Did you have something in mind?Watch your step up here.Woop!Smells so good.Miles, this is perfect.I didn't know girls could bethis excited about camping.Well, don't judge a bookby its cover, mister.Look, there's a path thatleads right to the water.Perfect.Come on. We got work to do.Got to set up camp.This looks brand new.Yeah. I just do asleeping bag, usually.So you bought this for me?It's not only for you.This will save myknees big time.You're such a horny bastard.Says the smut writer.Mm-hmm.Tickle, tickle, tickle!Seriously?Seriously. Takeyour shorts off.I figured you were thirsty.We've earned these.Yeah, camping is hard.Mountain air suits you.I'm just in a good mood.It's amazing how much nicerlife is with no drama.Do you ever talk to your ex?Not a word, and that's good.You never told me how you foundout she was cheating on you.She got pregnant.With some rich old guy's kid.We were on a break at the time.Wow.The layers.Do you think that shegot pregnant on purpose?No.Yes?I don't know. Probably.I have to wonder whatkind of a fuckwit I wasto not really realize.She was always money obsessed.Thought being a mechanicwas too blue-collar.Wanted me to make more money.You seem like you'redoing just fine to me.See, thank you.I'm just pissed off I wastedthe best years ofmy life with her.Who said they werethe best years?Look around you, Miles.It's a pretty beautiful day.You want for nothing.That is an incrediblequality in a person.And, I mean, look atyou. You're smoking hot.You got a great job.House, friends.Really sexy fuck buddy.Thank you.So don't sweat the past.Focus on the now.Seriously, right now,my bobber disappearedseveral minutes ago, andI don't know what to do.Shit, you gotta bite.Are you kidding me?I caught a bicycle tire.What the hell, Colorado?Way to keep itclassy. My hands hurt.Surely you could seethe irony in this.Babe, you caught a tire.This is kismet.Truth or dare?Truth.Do you ever get horny inthe garage at Tire Depot?What?You're working ona customer's carand your hands aregetting really dirtyand you're just really...digging in there.I'm afraid not.Damn.But classic car workon the other hand,if I'm working on one of thoseand an old car that hasn'trun in fucking decadesand suddenly roars to life,then hell yes.Rock solid.Ha. I knew it.Perverts attract perverts.Okay. Truth or dare?Dare.Ooh, somebody has secrets.Shut up.Skinny dip in the lake.The lake that birthedmy blessed tire? No way.Who knows what the hellelse is in that thing?It's fine. I knewyou wouldn't do it.All talk and no action.A-hem.Need I remind you who has beensneaking into TireDepot for weeks now?You call that dangerous?I am consumingcomplimentary beverageswithout service miles.That is just as bad as thieving.Such a cold hard criminal.Fine, I'll do it.But you have to do it with me.And why would I do that?Because I'll be naked.Come on, now. Wemade it this far.Is that gonna hurt whenyou jump in the water?Not if you hold it.Come on!Cannonball!Whoo-hoo!Mercedes?Do you feel like...Do you feel that?Feel what?Oh, my God, that's freezing!Oh...Good morning.Morning.You've been busy this morning.Yeah, it's a muddy mess,so I figured we shouldhead back early.Oh, okay.What can I do to help?I forgot the pancake mix.Don't read into that.Well, thanks for thehelp with the research.Anytime.You okay?I'm just tired.Shouldn't have gottenthe mattress pad.Mm-Hmm.Looks like you got company.I'll see you later, Mercedes.Okay. Bye.Hi, Dean.Hey, Kate.Want to come in for some coffee?Is it complimentary?For people who aren'tassholes, it is.Nothing to say about thatloud muffler on Miles's truck?I'm surprised you knowwhat a muffler is.I'm learning.I am, too.I'm really sorry, Kate.Come on in, then.Did you spend the night atMiles's house last night?Are you really asking that?I'm just making smalltalk, Kate. I promise.No judgment.We were camping.- Camping?- It was for book research.And it was really fun.Writing something different?Trying to.Inspiration must be flowing.It has its moments.And Miles is the guy thatbrings this out in you.He's certainly nothurting things.So different from me.Dean, look.I never had a clue thatyou had feelings for me.If I had, I would have doneso many things differently.Like what?I don't know.Maybe come over less often.I'm sorry if I led youto believe otherwise.No, no.You were just being yourself.It's pretty magnetic.Weird to get a compliment fromsomeone you just rejected.I think that if you really likehim, you need to come clean.Start by tellinghim your real name,and end with the fact that youstill live with your ex, Kate.The longer you wait,the harder it'll be.But I moved hisstuff out, at least.If he really cares,he'll forgive you.I'm telling youthis as your friend.So we're still friends?Only if I can stillwear my fancy pants.Done.We've been here five minutes.How much longer do you need?It's a fucking tire.How long can it take?Just checking the warranty, sir.If for some reason yourtire isn't repairable,we'd have to...Whoa, whoa, why can'tmy tire be repaired?Well, if there's apuncture in the sidewall,those aren't fixable,unfortunately,so we'd have to go in...What a rip-off!Who's a manager?I want to talk tothem right now.Bro, who's that chick?She's a customer service rep.Perfect. We'll take her.I'm afraid youdon't get to pick.Yeah, I think wecould if we wanted to.Hey, this isn't ordering a girloff the fucking Internet, moron.Do you want your fuckingtire fixed or not?Buddy...Manager. Now.Just go back to the shop.I'll let my uncle dealwith these guys, okay?Yeah, why don't youto go back to the shopand let your boytalk to this out.What kind of businessare you running?Whoa, whoa, whoa!What'd that licoriceever do to you?Nothing.What's going on with you?You look ready to ripsomeone's head off.Nice dress.You like it?So long as youdon't twirl in it.What is wrong with you?Nothing.Just some entitled customersgetting on my nerves.Do me a favor and don't go intothe customer comfortcenter today, okay?Sure.Would me going over toyours tonight cheer you up?Tonight?After work maybe?I want to see your house,specifically your garage.You know, research.Get our hands dirty.Fine.Wow.Moody's kind of hot on you.Oh my God, Miles.This is stunning.1965 Ford pickup.Got the paint done lastmonth, interior last week.All she needs nowis a new carburetor.For combustion.You remember that?Duh.The orgasm of the engine.Well, it might take a while.I can't find the rightone to save my life.They're prettyrare and expensive.You said it was your grandpa's?Looks like it belongsin a Pixar film.Yeah.He passed away two years ago.I'm so sorry to hear that.He was 77, so hehad a solid run.Thought he wasgonna live forever.Hey, he always kept littlecandies in the glove box.You want one?Uh, no. No.If those were your grandpa's,it should stay where they are.I wish I had it running already.It was sort of a dyingpromise I made to him.Joss always got pissed at mewhen I worked on this truck.I feel bad I haven'tfinished it yet.Miles.Look at this thing.It's art.And you've alreadydone so much to it.He would've loved you.Oh, yeah?Yeah.You're real.You don't put ona show for people.Everything you say isexactly what you are.He would've lovedyour name, too.Mercedes?

It does.I'm happy for you.It's just Mercedes hasn'ttexted me back in days,and that's unlike her.You're pining afteryour fuck buddy?She's not a fuck buddy.Watch how you fuckingspeak about her.I'm not joking.Okay.But don't let thatgirl get in your headand force you to miss outon a great opportunity.Come on. Let's go celebrate.Mmm, mm.Dryston is back.Shut up.What did you say?I told him that hisstuff is in storage.I was changing the locks.I'll pay him the depositand that I'm not moving.Good for you.You finally got Drystonout of your life for good,and it was about damn time.Now I just have to comeclean to Miles about my name.I've been avoiding him untilthis Dryston stuff got sorted.Real life is so much morecomplicated than fiction.I just want a real life romance.You got this.I've got nothingexcept a full bladder.I'm going to go peeand get us refills.Yes, please.God damn, Katie.Did you look thisgood when I left?Did you follow me here?I didn't have to.
