Theleadership...Mum!What's wrong?A bad dream?They hurt her.I know.It's said some peopleare so full of faith,they give strengthto everyone around them.A different sort of strengthhere.Did your mother ever tell youthe story of Our Lady, Fatima,daughter to the ProphetMuhammad?Peace be upon them.I know she was a good lady.She was very special!It's a wonderful story,and it begins when Our Ladyis still a little girl.People loved her and called her"the Lady of Heaven."Even back then,the oppressed were persecutedfor their beliefs.For years they lived in Mecca,under pagan brutality,forcing them to flee.Brave until the end,Lady Fatima was the last toleave.Her journey acrossthe harsh Arabian desert......would be the first test ofher resolveon the long journey ahead.The believers followed a greatmanwho had been destinedto start a new order.To build a better future.He was her father, Muhammad.Prophet of God on Earth.Is that really him?This prophet they speak of.Why are the people of Meccaso afraid of him?They have turned Medinainto a sanctuary for theirpeople.These Muslims are bad forbusiness.This man of Godcares only for his little girl.He refuses to enter the citywithout her.The leaders of Meccawill never let that happen.What are you building?The future.Outside the city of Medina,he and a group of companionsbuilt a mosque.Awaiting the Lady's arrivalamongst those who had followedhimacross the desertto a place of refuge,where they could finally livein peace and harmony.The Prophet knewthe Lady's journey from Mecca toMedinawould be dangerous.Their enemies would stop atnothingto prevent themfrom entering the city together.What did he do?He entrusted her safetyto his most loyal servant, ImamAli.Look!Ali, did you think you wouldget away with this?The daughter of Muhammadcannot go to her father.You must surrender.And if I do not?If you do not,we shall return to Meccawith your severed head.He cut him in half!Imam Alihad tremendous strength andpower.But sometimes Imam Alidefeated evil without killinganyone.How?His heart was stronger than hishand.He had a very big heart.And if you have a heart likehim,you will be victorious too.My Prophet.My Prophet!The best of tidings.They have arrived.Your daughter is here.Welcome, my Prophet.This place, Medina,will offer protection to all.Muslim, Jew, and non-Muslim.The time of oppression is over.All the tribes...All the tribes will live hereas one nation in righteousness.We will help each other,support the oppressed,forgive the wrongdoers,and defend against any invaders.Everyone will have the freedomto practice their religion.Do you really thinkour people will be safe?Time will tell.Asylum is given to whomeverrequests it.No matter the tribe,no matter the religion.And this scroll bears the sealof the messenger of God,the Prophet Muhammad.And here we will be build themosqueof our saviour Muhammad!Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad!Muhammad!In the name of God,the Most Gracious, the MostMerciful.The greatest thingin this life and the hereafteris the spreading of peace in theworld.All the prophets, and theirsuccessorswere sent here with this goal.I am the last of the prophets.And my successors will comethrough my daughter Fatima,the Lady of Heaven.She is a part of me.Whoever hurts her, has hurt me.If you had a wife,you wouldn't be this messy.Well, my messy selfis what keeps me alive on thebattlefield.I've found someone for you,-she's very...-Very beautiful?I met her with her motherat the mosque last Friday.-I'm sure you will suit...-Suit each other so well?Morning, Laith. Sleep well?See you later.So, what do you want forbreakfast?Same as him.So, doesn't Raed want to getmarried?All Raed thinks aboutis being a good soldier.Aren't all soldiers like that?Imam Ali was not your typicalsoldier.My Prophet...My Prophet.You knowmy heart is devoted to youand your message.-I have never abandoned youin...-Ali...Perhaps, you are askingfor the hand of Fatima.Yes, my Prophet.Ali!Slow down.You bring up so much water,I am afraid the earth itselfwill run out!I cannot believe it.You are the greatest warrior ofthe Arabs.The bravest of them all!And you are marrying a familywho cannot muster uptheir meal for the day.Now, if you were to marry mydaughter...We are people who are happywith what God has given us.We take pride in our actions,not in our wealth.From now on, I think I willonly hire warriors to work forme.Look who's here.Imam Ali.Imam.Imam Ali, the lion is here.Thank you.We hear a lady has wonthis warrior's heart,and this warrior needs a greatdowryto impress her father?This father-in-law of yours hasworkedso hard to make Medina safeagain.Saeed starts the bidding at 100dirhams.I say 150 dirhams.Go on.I bid 190.Two hundred.-Two thirty.-Three hundred.-Four fifty.-Five hundred.Five hundred!Saeed wins!Now that is a very fine shieldindeed.-Assalam-alaikum, Father.-Walaikum-assalam.Can I ask that my dowry bedifferent?What is the dowry that you wishfor?Intercession for sinners,so they may enter into heaven.O my Lord!They are the most beloved to me.So love and protect them,and bring their heartstogether in harmony.My Lord, make themand their descendantsthe inheritors of Paradise.Bestow upon them a pure,blessed, and benevolent progeny,whom you make leadersguiding by your command.Greetings, Ali and Fatima.You look like a couple of starsshining in the night sky.Ali, you have the most blessedof wives.Fatima, you have the greatest ofhusbands.I seek refuge in you, my Lord,from Satan,for her and for her descendants.-Raed?-Stay where you are.It's okay.What happened?I don't know yet.There are huge smoke clouds.Yes, sir?I'll be there right away.Well, what's happening?They bombed Al-Karrada.I'm ordered to help control thesituation.Wait.Here.Take this with you.May God protect you.I'll be back, Inshallah.Don't worry.Be good.Laith,make sure you look after Bibi.Are there any battles in ourstory?There is one.It's a huge one.It was only three yearsafter the Prophet arrived atMedina.The pagans from Mecca,wanted revenge on our Prophetfor the battlethey'd lost the year before,the Battle of Badr.Now, Abu Sufyan's armymarched to Uhud to fight themagain.They come.How many?Thousands.Many thousands.Bilal, my dear friend,we must tell the archers.No matter what happens,they must understandwhat the Prophet told us.They must not leave theirpositions.The Lady wove Imam Ali a shirt,made with something strongerthan any shield,the Lady's love.With her prayers, he had thebest defencefor the battle ahead.For the sake of the Lord youworship,I ask for mercy.Do not kill me.Onwards and kill them!With his banner fallen,Abu Sufyan's rage overtook him.He was defeated.The Prophet's commandsto the archers were clear,"Stand your ground,no matter the outcome."But seeing the pagans fallen,the archers abandoned theirposts.Spying a perfect opportunity,the pagans crept aroundthe other side of the mountain,ready to ambush.Gathering their spoils,the Prophet's army was leftunprotected.All for the sake of greed.Father!Do not die.No, my son.True life begins now.Listen to me.My last wishis to protect the Prophet.He is our saviour,and he shall have all my landsand groves.Father.-To the mountain!-To the mountain!Live,and pay me another day.Save yourselves!How can you abandon yourProphet?Run, save yourselves!Out of the way!My Prophet.Ask the Lordto send down his wrath uponthem.Muhammad has been killed!Muhammad has been killed!The Prophet is no more.The Prophet is gone.The Prophet has left us.We must turn backto the religion of our fathers.Hearing the Prophet was dead,they lost faith,and threw down their weapons.You fools! The Prophet is alive.Do not betray him.Anyone who says the Prophet iskilledwill taste my blade.Where is Muhammad?Does he live?Do not answer him.This is the order of theProphet.The Prophet lives!The Prophet lives!The Prophet lives!The Prophet lives!The Prophet lives!I think it is true.He lives.The fallen soldierhad been wrongly identified.The Prophet was still alive.Abu Sufyan realised the battlewas over.There was no victory that day.The Muslims hung their heads inshame.Their greed came at a high cost.The Lady was relieved to findher fatherand husband alive,but distressedat the sight of their wounds.She tended to them, and healedtheir pain.My Lord has revealed...Do not weaken,and nor should you grieve.Through this you shall besuperiorif you are true believers.If a wound has touched you,then know that a wound similarto ithas touched the opposing people.That is how the Lordmay purify the believers.Do you see that you willenter into Paradisewhile the Lord has not madeevident thosewho fight in His cause,and those who are steadfast?I, Muhammad,am but a messenger.Before me, other messengershave come and gone.If I was to die,or be killed,how easily would you lose yourfaith?It seems like the Lordis no longer protecting him.Even in his own house,the Prophet had eyes on him.His wife, Aisha,daughter of Abu Bakr,she was consumed with jealousy.-Assalam-alaikum, my Lady.-Walaikum-assalam.My Lady, please!Allow me.Your son needs you.Did you know your fatherwas betrayed and abandoned?We nearly lost him.I don't know how the Prophetcan tolerate them.He even smiles in their faces.Smiling in the face of an enemywill save you from hellfire.Smiling in the face of an allywill allow you into heaven.There is some good news, myLady.The groves of Mukhayreeqhave produced an exceptionalcrop.We will get morethan a fair price at market,-and the money will...-We should distribute it amongstthe poor.God gives me everything I need.I learned from my fatherthat generosity is a tree inheaven.Its branches reach out acrossour world.No wonderthey call her the Lady ofHeaven.Why do you let them talk to youlike that?They are nothing but pigs andapes.Stop it, Aisha. Do not beobscene.God hates such language.It is obvious.You love your daughter Fatimaand her husband more than me.And my father!Assalam-alaikum, my daughter.Walaikum-assalam, Father.My daughter, I feel fatigue inmy body.Would you bring me the Yemenicloak?The Lady's family gatheredunderneath her father's cloak.God declared for all to hearthat the Lady's family was themost pure.Generations to comewould be inspired by theirgoodness.God's declaration echoedacross the heavens and theearth.My Lord, this is my household.Their flesh is my flesh.And their blood is my blood.Whatever hurts and saddens them,hurts and saddens me.They are a part of meand I am a part of them.So, allow your blessings todescendupon them and keep them purethrough a perfect purification.Then a voice came from above."God intends only to keep awayfrom you the impurity of sin,"O, people of the Prophet'shousehold,"and purify youthrough a perfect purification."O, my angelsand the inhabitants of myheavens."I did not createany well-established sky,"extended land, glowing moon,"shining sun, revolving planet,"flowing ocean, or moving arc,"except for the love of thesefive."Fatima, her father,her husband and her sons."What happened?Suicide bomber.Car full of explosives.A woman.But how did she get past thecheckpoint?Eighty-four dead.Dozens injured.Women, children....was the resultof a female suicide bomberwho infiltrated the cityby deceiving her cousin,a police sergeant, who waskilledin the same blast.She detonated anexplosives-laden carstraight after passinga Karrada security checkpoint.Terrorist group ISIS haveclaimedresponsibility for the attack...You okay?Reports claim that at least 84have been killed, and 114wounded...Why would anyone hurt theirfamily?The Quran teaches us thatsometimesbad things come from the peopleclosest to us.This even happened to theProphet.Thirty-four traitorsplotted against the Prophet.They vowed that after theProphet's death,they would claim back what wastheirs,return to the old tribal waysand rule.A secret pact was made.The Prophet was well awareof their treachery.He could have retaliated.But it was more important forhimto demonstrate to his peoplethe values of tolerance andforgiveness.He led themon the holy pilgrimage to Meccaafter liberating it from thepagans.He wanted to show them thatunder Islam,and even in the face of all thisdanger,if they believed in him,God would protect them.It was all in God's plan.As the Muslims made the journeyback to Medina,the Prophet asked his believersto join him at Ghadeer Khummfor a most important gathering.God had a final message todeliver.My Lord informed me that he willcall me to him shortly...My Lord informed me that he willcall me to him shortly.I will leave behind for youtwo weighty things.I will leave behind for youtwo weighty things.And they will bothgive you guidance in the future.And they will both give youguidance in the future.The Book of God and my blessedfamily.Look at his eyes.There is madness there.Ali will be leader after me.My Lord guided meto appoint him as my successor.My Lord guided meto appoint him as my successor.God has blessed me with hislight.God has blessed me with hislight.And this light will continue...And this light will continue......in the 12 legitimate leadersafter medescended from my linethrough my daughter Fatima.Ali is the chosen.He is the first and the Mahdi isthe last.Whoever takes me as his leadermust take Alias their leader.This is outrageous.I'm to follow who?The husband of his daughter?This did not come from God.This is his design.If he thinks when he dies or iskilled,his household will just inheritthe leadership...No.Never.Truly a great day.I pay allegiance.My Imam.Blessed day.I pledge allegiance to you.Imam.You heard it from his own mouth.When he returns to Medina,Ali will take over.What can we do?See that he does not return.The Prophet journeyed backto Medina to put in writingwhat he had proclaimed for allto hear.But some would stop at nothingto prevent the peacefultransition of power.So he separated himselffrom the crowd to protect them,and took the narrower,more dangerous path.-Let us take them.-No, let them be.I have been sent as mercy tothis world.I will not have it said thatMuhammadis a killer of his companions.The Prophet's forgivingnature......did not stop them fromplanningto sabotage his life again.He was well awareof the continuous plots againsthim.When illness befell the Prophet,his orders were clear.No one should administerany medicine to him.Two traitors instigated by theirfathersdid not obey.Come on. In you come.-What was that?-A dangerous spider.No, I mean in the bottle.Poison.How could a wife kill herhusband?Just like those spiders.Black widow spiders are knownto kill their husbands.-Really?-They're poisonous too.Those spiders.Why doesn't the Prophet fightback?He has to do something.But what if he knew deep downthat the best plan is to donothing?Just to wait.Sometimes, even warriorshave to hold their breath.My time is near.And afterwards,you will all face many trials.But you, my lovely Fatima,you are destined to endure themost.They will gatherin their oppression of you.Sanctity will be violated.Be patient, my brother.I know you will be denounced.I know you will be challenged.But remember, whatever happens,be patient.Go to my father.Now is the time. Let him leadthe prayer.Abu Bakr will lead the prayer.The Prophet commands it.Abu Bakr will lead the prayer.What has happened to him?Beware. I fear some of you aredrowning...in your dissension against God.Do not split like the Tribes ofIsrael.Follow the Book of God...and my household.For most in his beloved city,this was a day of extremesadness.But others saw this as theiropportunity.Wait, let him speak.Wait.Let him speak.The cal...The caliphate should be ours.The tribes of Ansarare the first people of Medina.Muhammad would not have beenableto establish his religionwithout us.Wait!But what of the Muhajireen?They will never agree.They will claim the caliphate,because they are fromthe same tribe as the Prophet.Then we willforce them to have two caliphs.One from us and one from them.No.This will be the first sign ofweakness.He is right. It will never work.Absolute power has to be theonly way.We will never accept this.This is impossible.The Muhajireen will never acceptthis.Absolute power! Seize thecaliphate!Please... No...This is a betrayal of theProphet.The Prophet gave us Ali.Yeah, he's right.Hurry to the Saqifa. The Ansarare meeting to announce a newcaliphate.Whatever we do, we must act now.I vote for two caliphs.Two caliphs.This is not the will of theProphet.This is a coup!Just Ali.We will not pay allegianceto anyone except Ali.-Ali.-Just Ali.There is a rising against you.You know, they planto seize the caliphate from you.Go and announce your caliphate.-If you do not, they...-I will not leave the Prophet.Two caliphs! Two caliphs!Two swords will not fitwithin one scabbard.Then you and your tribesmust leave Medina.-And God will destroy you!-No. It will be you who isdestroyed.-Get out of Medina.-Never!Get out. Traitor.Are you siding with them?Traitors.The body of the Prophet is stillunburied,and you are disputing hissuccessorship.Shame on you!Shame on you!Ali. Just Ali.Ali!Quiet! Please listen.Tribes of the Ansar, you werethe first to strive for a betterway.Do not be the firstto change it for the worse.Tribes of the Ansar,no one can ignoreyour pioneering role in Islam.But we, the Muhajireen,are of the same blood as theProphet.So, his successorshould be chosen from our tribe.No, no...Affairs of the caliphatewill not be run withoutconsulting you.Join us.Join us and youwill be our ministers. You.You!I agree.I swear my allegiance to you,caliph.I also swear my allegiance,caliph.This is not the will of theProphet.I too swear allegiance, caliph.I swear allegiance, caliph.Caliph.Abu Bakr.Abu Bakr.To the mosque.Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr...You are killing my father.Kill him. May God kill him!Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr...Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr.Abu Bakr...Silence!I never asked for leadership,but the people have chosen me.If you do as I askand pledge your allegiance tome,you will find me a fair leader.But if you choose another path,beware,for there is a devil within me.Sorry.Why don't you go and wash yourhands.Lunch is nearly ready.Go on.Is it good?So, did he have a plan?Yes, Imam Ali had a plan.To test his followers, provingto themthey're not as faithful as theybelieve.We swear by God that you arethe commander of the faithful.Give us your hand, and we willswear allegiance to you and youalone.Are you sure?Prove this to me.Come back tomorrow with yourheads shaved.Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!Pay allegiance.Everybody else did.If you do not...you will be judged by the sword.I will pay allegiance to AbuBakr.Caliph.Caliph.My caliph.Caliph.My caliph.The next morning, Imam Aliwaited for his followers toarrive.He knew that mostwould fail this test of faith.Only four arrived.Master, what should we do?Go home.Please, wait.If you cannot even shave yourheads,how could you face mountains ofsteel?There is nothing for you here.The Prophet had entrustedImam Ali with a most importanttask,to compile all the chapters ofthe Quranand their true interpretations.Lady Fatimaprepared for the birth of theirchild,while taking careof her husband and children.Obey me for as long as I obeyGod.When I act righteously, thensupport me.And if my path falters, then...These are lies.The Prophet told us,"Ali is our commander and mysuccessor."If you disobey him,your religion will bedistorted."Silence!Nobody asked for your opinion.Why should we support you?Ali has greater knowledge,and he is closer to the Prophet.Repent, Abu Bakr.Do not betray the last of theProphet's...Speak again and lose your head!Ali. Ali.I have been occupied because Ihave beenattending to the orders of theProphet.I have been compiling the HolyQuran,every verse and its explanation.This was the last order of ourProphet.We have our own version.We do not need yours.So, you have rejected this Quranas you have rejected us,the household of the Prophet.Imam Ali's wordshad moved the people to followhim again.But after his test, it wasapparentthey could not be depended upon,when their faithwas not fully in their hearts.The path of darkness has beenchosen.The whole world will becomedark.Do not be deceived.Drink from the water you know tobe pure,and Islam will be illuminatedfor you.Imam...why do you not fight back?Surely, we must fight.No swords.No bloodshed.Massively outnumbered,and their faith still unsteady,they would never win in a fight.Imam Ali's plan to preservethe Muslim nation was in action.But some still begged him for afight.All under watchful eyes.They still gather at his house.Although Lady Fatima waspregnant,she insisted on supportingher husband's right to theleadership,calling on peopleto not succumb to tyranny.Sadly, they were too scared ofretaliationto follow their principles.They were seen going house tohouse.If Ali stirs up more support,then...Ali. All I ever hear is Ali!Aren't you going to do anythingat all?Yes.Of course.This problem with Ali must beresolved.Leave it to me.I will let the beast deal withhim.Qunfudh. My cousin.The successor of the Prophetcalls you.The Prophet did not appointAbu Bakr as his successor.Just come to Abu Bakr.I will not pay allegiance tohim.We are here for Ali!Bring him out or we will comein!I forbid you to enter thishouse.You did not attendthe funeral of my father.Instead, you lusted after power.Your greed will be judged byGod.Gather the wood, we will burnher out.This is wrong.Come on, gather the wood.We cannot do this. This is toofar.You are goingto let a woman tell us what todo?Finish thiswith as much brutality as youneed.Gather all the wood and set aspark to it.Come out, Ali.Come out, Ali.Swear allegiance to Abu Bakr!What do you want from us?Why are you at the door?Because of your tyranny, yourogue.They will gatherin their oppression of you.Sanctity will be violated.Be patient, my brother.I know you will be denounced.I know you will be challenged.But remember,whatever happens, be patient.Are you trying to scare mewith this party of the devil?Tell Ali to face us.I have no respect for you,and I will not summon Ali foryou.If Ali does not come out,your house will burn.You would burnthe daughter of your Prophet?And her children?You seek to end the line of theProphetand extinguish the light of God?Stop this foolishness, Fatima.There is no Muhammad any more,and I see no deliverance,no angels coming down fromHeaven.Oh, my father, messenger of God.Look what is happening to usat the hands of Abu Bakr andOmar.You come out, Ali.Burn the house down. Burn itdown!Burn it down!No. Please. You cannot do this.This is the house of the Lady,and she is inside with herchildren.Even so!No. Please.Move quickly.They killed our baby.Fidda!Be patient, my brother.If the Prophet did notcommand me to be patientand resign to the will of God,you would have never dared entermy house.Get me out of here.Take him.Defending her husband,with her wounds still bleeding,Our Lady did what no one elsedared.Abu Bakr,do you wish to make a widow ofme?For my children to be orphans?If you do not release myhusband,I will go to the grave of myfatherin his bloodied garment,and I will scream to my Lordand pull his wrath down upon youall.Don't allow this punishmentto strike down the people ofMedina.Hurry to the daughter ofMuhammad.Tell not to bring thispunishment down.Do you hear me, Abu Bakr?Do you want my wrath to raindown on you?My Lady, the Lord sent yourfatheras a mercy. Please return home.They dare to kill my husband.Please, my Lady. Ali begs you.I am sorry, Father.They took your beloved Ali away,with a rope around his neck.Did you not pay allegianceto me at Ghadeerby the orders of the Prophet?Stop this nonsense.Pay allegiance to the newcaliph.Do something.This man leads a rebellion. Killhim!Please, caliph.I beg you. Show mercy on mynephew.I will guarantee.He will do what you need him todo.Ali has pledged allegiance.There is nothing more to seehere.Go home.My Lady, you must see this.It was a boy.God blessed you with anotherson.She is a part of me.My father, messenger of God.Whoever hurts her has hurt me.What is happening to usat the hands of Abu Bakr?Get out!Abu Bakr was not at peace.He began to lash out again,demanding thingshe knew would hurt Our Lady.He plotted to seizeall the lands of the Lady,including the beautiful land ofFadak,which had beengifted to her by her father.These lands now belong to thecaliphate.No.All praise be to God who letshis word reach the hearts of thepeople.He created justice to allowour hearts to come together inharmony.He saved you through my father,Muhammad,and my husband, Ali.Now, with my fatherno longer here to lead us,the evil is with thosewho will extinguish the light oftruth.They will return usto a time of ignorance.This new path of complicityand oppression has been set out.If you continue this way,then blood will be shedbetween all of you.What is all this?What, dissension?Women are but pawns of others.Some men rely on themto fulfil their own desires.No!Just like those who encouragetheir women to prostitution.But hark my words.Our wealth is vast under myleadership.Shame on you!Go to the treasury.Your reward awaits you.At the treasury.Abu Bakr was able to buy off thetownsfolkby appealing to their greed.We have cometo collect taxes for Abu Bakr.But others, spurred onby the words of Our Lady, heldfirm.And when local tribes receivedorders to pay taxes, theyrefused.They announced that theirloyaltybelonged only to the Prophetand his rightful successor.In the name of God, from me, AbuBakr,the caliph to the Prophet,hear this proclamation.Horses!I demand you respect my command.I demand your obedience.You must obey the laws and paytaxes.If not...what you have will beconfiscated.We will wipe your tribefrom the face of the earthand take your women as slaves.The greatest thingin this life and the hereafteris the spreading of peace in theworld.Through all this, the Ladyshelteredfrom the baking sun under atree.This is whereshe tried to heal her wounds.Abu Bakr knewthis tree was Our Lady's refuge.To hurt her even more, he cut itdown.During all these challenges,the Imam was her protector andcomforter.He built a new shelter,the house of sorrow.Afraid that her tearswould provoke sympathy,Abu Bakr and his elite allegedthat the Lady's crying disturbedthem.The house of sorrowwas far away from them all.For 27 days, she grievedfor her father,for her unborn child theysnatched away.Her health decayed after theassault.Her wounds didn't heal.She knew her time was near.I despise this world that hasbecomea breeding ground of violence.Its shadow will be castacross many generations to come.My brave Ali,when I go, no one...Not Abu Bakr...Not Omar...No one must know where I lie.Ever-living God, please helpyour servant,welcome me into Heavenand reunite me with my father.And this is how the Lady wasburied.In secret, alone.As Imam Ali prepared her bodyfor burial,he found her ribhad been broken in the assault.She had hidden her pain fromhim.The people realisedhow much she had suffered,and how she had borne it withpatience.She had won their hearts.As foretold by the Lady, for1400 years,the direction of historyshifted to oppression andtyranny.But her legacy lived on,inspiring others to stand upto their oppressors,speaking out, no matter what thecost.Just like your mother spoke outfor you.My darling.My mum...I miss her so much.Her name was Fatima.Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.I didn't know.It's okay to cry.Tears are a blessing from God.We all need to cry.Jamal?You need to get out of here.Now.What are you talking about?I'm here to pray for my motherand remember the Lady.Is everything all right? What'sgoing on?I've missed you.You left me.No, listen, I had no choice.Breathe slowly, Jamal. Slowly.-Listen.-What?Listen. Get out of here. Now!No. Jamal. No. This isn't theway.Don't let them fool you.This isn't Islam. This isn'tyou.-Please.-I have to do this.Jamal, no. Don't. Please.You're with me.Let's get out of here.Come on, let's get out of here.Look out. Terrorist!Show me your hands!-Show me your hands!-No, wait.It's okay.Keep your hands up or I'llshoot.Don't shoot, he's my friend.Laith. What are you doing?Step away, now.No. You don't understand. He wastricked.Show me your hands,both of you. Final warning.Keep your hands up or I willshoot.Wait. I know this boy.Laith, what's going on? Come on.Come on, get behind me.Please trust me.
